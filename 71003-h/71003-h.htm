  <h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

  <p>In their use of the word Katcina<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the Hopi or Moki apply the term to
    supernatural beings impersonated by men wearing masks or by statuettes
    in imitation of the same. The dances in which the former appear are
    likewise called by the same name which with the orthography “Cachena”
    is used in descriptions of these dances in the valley of the upper
    Rio Grande. The present use of the term among the Tusayan Indians
    leads me to consider it as almost a synonym of a supernatural being of
    subordinate rank to the great deities. Ancestral worship plays a not
    inconspicuous part in the Hopi conception of a Katcina.</p>

  <p>When we endeavor to classify the ceremonials which form the ritual
    practiced by the Tusayan villagers, the subject is found to be
    so complex that it can be adequately treated only by the help of
    observations extending through many years. The plan which I have
    followed in my work, as will be seen in previous publications, has
    been to gather and record data in regard to the details of individual
    observances as a basis for generalization.</p>

  <p>My former publications on this subject have therefore been simply
    records of observations.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> For various reasons it has seemed well
    to anticipate a final and general account and interpretation, with
    tentative efforts at a classification to serve as a stepping-stone
    to a more exhaustive and complete discussion of the relationship of
    these observances, which would naturally appear in an elaborate memoir
    necessitating a broader method of treatment than any yet adopted.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

  <p>At the present stage of my researches it would be too early to
    write such an account of the ceremonial calendar of the Tusayan
    villagers, but it has been deemed well to put on record, with many new
    observations, this preliminary outline of what may be a portion of a
    general system, to aid other investigators in kindred fields of study.
    When I began my work, four years ago, the task of bringing order out of
    what appeared to be a hopeless confusion seemed well nigh impossible,
    but as one ceremony after another was studied it was found that the
    exactness of the ritual as exemplified in ceremonial presentations
    pertained even to details, and that there was a logical connection
    running throughout all the religious observances of the Tusayan
    Indians, the presentations of which were practically little influenced
    by white races with whom the people had been brought in contact. As
    these ceremonials were studied more sympathetically I discovered a
    unity throughout them which, whatever their origin may have been,
    placed them in marked contrast to those of the nomads by whom they were
    surrounded. They were found to belong to a type or ceremonial area in
    which the other Pueblos are embraced, the affinities of which carry us
    into different geographic regions of the American continent.</p>

  <p>But while this type differs or differed in ancient times from those of
    Athapascan or Shoshonean aborigines, it bears evidence of a composite
    nature. It had become so by contributions from many sources, and had
    in turn left its impress on other areas, so that as a type the Pueblo
    culture was the only one of its kind in aboriginal America. With strong
    affinities on all sides it was unique, having nearest kinship with
    those of Mexico and Central America.</p>

  <p>The geographic extension of the Pueblo type of culture was no doubt
    formerly much greater than it is at the present time. What its
    original boundaries were future investigation will no doubt help us
    to decide, but the problem at present before us is the determination
    of its characteristics as a survival in our times. When once this
    is satisfactorily known, and not until then, can we advance with
    confidence to wider generalizations as to its past distribution and
    offer theories regarding its affinities with other ceremonial areas of
    the American race.</p>

  <p>It is doubtless true that we are not progressing beyond what can be
    claimed to be known when we say that all the Pueblo peoples belong to
    the same ceremonial type. I am sure that in prehistoric and historic
    times delegations from the Rio Grande country have settled among
    the Tusayan villagers, and that many families of the latter have
    migrated back to the Rio Grande again to make permanent homes in that
    section. The most western and the most eastern peoples of this Pueblo
    culture-stock have been repeatedly united in marriage, bringing about a
    consequent commingling of blood, and the legends of both tell of their
    common character. It is too early in research to inject into science
    the idea that the Pueblos are modified Indians of other stocks, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
    we outstrip our knowledge of facts if we ascribe to any one village or
    group of villages the implication involved in the expression, “Father
    of the Pueblos.” Part of the Pueblo culture is autochthonal, but its
    germ may have originated elsewhere, and no one existing Pueblo people
    is able satisfactorily to support the claim that it is ancestral
    outside of a very limited area.</p>

  <p>In the present article I have tried to present a picture of one of the
    two great natural groups of ceremonials into which the Tusayan ritual
    is divided. I have sought also to lay a foundation for comparative
    studies of the same group as it exists in other pueblos, but have
    not found sufficient data in regard to these celebrations in other
    villages to carry this comparative research very far. Notwithstanding
    these dances occur in most of the pueblos, the published data about
    them is too meager for comparative uses. No connected description of
    these ceremonies in other pueblos has been published; of theoretical
    explanations we have more than are profitable. It is to be hoped that
    the ever-increasing interest in the ceremonials of the Pueblos of the
    southwest will lead to didactic, exoteric accounts of the rituals of
    all these peoples, for a great field for research in this direction is
    yet to be tilled.</p>

  <p>In the use, throughout this article, of the words “gods,” “deities,”
    and “worship” we undoubtedly endow the subject with conceptions
    which do not exist in the Indian mind, but spring from philosophic
    ideas resulting from our higher culture. For the first two the more
    cumbersome term “supernatural beings”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is more expressive, and the
    word “spirit” is perhaps more convenient, except from the fact that it
    likewise has come to have a definite meaning unknown to the primitive
    mind.</p>

  <p>Worship, as we understand it, is not a proper term to use in the
    description of the Indian’s methods of approaching his supernal beings.
    It involves much which is unknown to him, and implies the existence
    of that which is foreign to his conceptions. Still, until some better
    nomenclature, more exactly defining his methods, is suggested, these
    terms from their convenience will still continue in common use.</p>

  <p>The dramatic element which is ascribed to the Katcina<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> ritual is more
    prominent in the elaborate than in the abbreviated presentations, as
    would naturally be the case, but even there it is believed to be less
    striking than in the second group or those in which the performers are
    without masks.</p>

  <p>There exists in Hopi mythology many stories of the old times which form
    an accompanying body of tradition explaining much of the symbolism
    and some of the ritual, but nowhere have I found the sequence of the
    ceremonials to closely correspond with the episodes of the myth. In
    the Snake or the Flute dramatizations this coincidence of myth and
    ritual is more striking, but in them it has not gone so far as to be
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>comparable with religious dramatizations of more cultured peoples.
    Among the Katcinas, however, it is more obscure or even very limited.
    While an abbreviated Katcina may be regarded as a reproduction of the
    celebrations recounted in legends of times when real supernatural
    beings visited the pueblos, and thus dramatizes semimythic stories, I
    fail to see aught else in them of the dramatic element.
  </p>

  <p>The characteristic symbolism is prescribed and strictly conforms to the
    legends. Explanations of why each Katcina is marked this or that way
    can be gathered from legends, but the continuous carrying out of the
    sequence of events in the life of any Katcina, or any story of creation
    or migration, did not appear in any abbreviated<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Katcina which was
    studied. In this subdivision a dramatic element is present, but only
    in the crudest form. In the elaborate Katcinas, however, we find an
    advance in the amount of dramatization, or an attempt to represent a
    story or parts of the same. Thus we can in Soyáluña follow a dramatic
    presentation of the legend of the conflict of the sun with hostile
    deities or powers, in which both are personified.</p>

  <p>I must plead ignorance of the esoteric aspect of the Tusayan
    conceptions of the Katcinas when such exists. This want of knowledge
    is immaterial, for the object of this article is simply to record what
    has been seen and goes no further. I will not say that a complete
    account of the Katcinas can be given by such a treatment, and do not
    know how much or how little of their esoterism has eluded me, but
    these observations are wholly exoteric records of events rather than
    esoteric explanations of causes. It is thought that such a treatment of
    the subject will be an important contribution to the appreciation of
    explanations which it naturally precedes.</p>

  <p>Although it seems probable that the ritual of primitive man contains
    elements of a more or less perfect dramatization of his mythology, I
    incline to the opinion that the ritual is the least variable and from
    it has grown the legend as we now know it. The question, Which came
    first, myth or ritual? is outside the scope of this article.</p>

  <p>Any one who has studied the ceremonial system of the Tusayan Indians
    will have noticed the predominance of great ceremonials in winter.
    From harvest time to planting there is a succession of celebrations of
    most complicated and varied nature, but from planting to harvesting
    all these rites are much curtailed. The simplest explanation of this
    condition would be, and probably is, necessity. There is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>not time
    enough to devote to great and elaborate ceremonials when the corn must
    be cared for. Time is then too precious, but when the corn is high and
    the crop is in sight, or during the long winter when the agriculturist
    is at home unemployed, then the superstitious mind has freedom to carry
    on elaborate rites and observances, and then naturally he takes part
    in the complex ceremonies. Hence the spring and early summer religious
    observances are abbreviated. Although the Pueblo farmer may thoroughly
    believe in his ceremonial system as efficacious, his human nature is
    too practical to consume the precious planting time with elaborate
    ceremonials. But when he sees that the crop is coming and harvest is at
    hand, then he begins the series of, to him, magnificent pageants which
    extend from the latter part of August until March of the following year.</p>

  <p>It has been proven by repeated observations of the same ceremonials
    that there is great constancy in the way successive presentations
    of the ritual are carried out year after year. The inevitable
    modifications resulting from the death of old priests undoubtedly in
    course of time affect individual observances, but their ritual is never
    voluntarily changed. The ceremonials which I have here and elsewhere
    described were not invented by them to show to me, nor will any
    religious society of the Hopi at the present day get up a ceremony to
    please the white man. Each observance is traditional and prescribed for
    a certain time of the year.</p>

  <p>The second part of the October (Ü′&NoBreak;cü) is said to be called Tü′hoe. If
    this is recognized as a lunar period we would have 14 divisions to
    the ceremonial year. In the Pamü′&NoBreak;iyawû, the Snake ceremony, and the
    Katcina’s return, the same Nüitiwa (struggle of maids for bowls, etc)
    occurs.</p>

  <p>It will be noticed that the five summer moons have the same names as
    those of the winter; by that I do not mean to discard the divisions
    “named” and “nameless,” elsewhere used on good authority. The questions
    regarding the nomenclature of the different moons and their number are
    very perplexing and not yet satisfactorily answered.</p>

  <p>The determination of the number of moons recognized in the year or
    the interval between the successive reappearance of the sun in his
    house (Táwaki) at the summer solstitial rising is a most important
    question, for a satisfactory answer to which my researches thus far
    are insufficient. Several of the priests have told me that there were
    13, as given above; but others say there are 12, and still others, 14.
    The comparative ethnologist, familiar with Mexican calendars, would be
    glad to accept the report that there were 13, in which case there would
    be introduced a remarkable harmony between peoples akin in many ways.
    Although, however, there is good evidence that 13 is recognized by some
    priests, the negative evidence must be mentioned, especially as it is
    derived from men whose knowledge of Hopi lore I have come to respect.
    I have, however, provisionally followed the opinion of those who hold
    that the Hopi recognize 13 ceremonial months in their calendar.</p>

  <p>If the second part of the Ü′&NoBreak;cü moon be called Tü′&NoBreak;hoe, we would have
    14 moons, which would give 6 between 2 Pówa, or 2 Pa, Kéle, Kyá,
    and divide the ceremonial year into two parts of 7 moons each. The
    Katcina’s return (Ükine), or the beginning of the Katcinas, then occurs
    in the Pa moon; they end in Kyá at the Nimán (last, farewell). The
    group of unmasked ceremonials (nine days) likewise begins at the Pa
    moon in the Snake or Flute, and ends at the winter, Kyá, or Soyáluña.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

  <p>In endeavoring to find some reason for the similarity of names in the
    two groups of months which compose the ceremonial year I have this
    interesting hint, dropped by one of the priests: “When we of the upper
    world,” he said, “are celebrating the winter Pa moon the people of the
    under world are engaged in the observance of the Snake or Flute, and
    vice versa.” The ceremonials in the two worlds are synchronous. “That
    is the reason,” said my informant, “that we make the Snake or Flute

    until the corresponding month of the following summer.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

  <h2 class="nobreak" id="MEANS_OF_DETERMINING_THE_TIME_FOR_CEREMONIALS">MEANS OF DETERMINING THE TIME FOR CEREMONIALS</h2>

  <p>Among the Hopi Indians there are priests (tawawympkiyas) skilled in the
    lore of the sun, who determine, by observations of the points on the
    horizon, where the sun rises or sets, the time of the year proper for
    religious ceremonials. Two of these points are called sun houses, one
    at tátyüka,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> which is called the sun house (táwaki) par excellence,
    another at kwiníwi, which also is called táwaki, or sun house.</p>

  <p>The points on the horizon used in the determination of ceremonial
    events are as follows:</p>

  <p>1. Táwaki (hütca, opening). The horizon point properly called savwúwee
    marks the cardinal point tátyüka or place of sunrise at the winter
    solstice. The winter ceremony Soyáluña is determined not by sunrise,
    but by sunset, although, as a general thing, the time of summer
    ceremonials is determined by observations of sunrise.</p>

  <p>2. Másnamüzrü (mási, drab or gray; namüzrü, wooded ridge). This point
    is the ridge or crest of the mesa, east of Püp′&NoBreak;ce.</p>

  <p>3. Pavüñ′&NoBreak;tcómo (pavüñ, young corn; tcómo, mound). A point on the old
    wagon trail to Fort Defiance, a little beyond the head of Keams canyon.</p>

  <p>4. Hoñwítcomo (derivation obscure; hóñwi, erect).</p>

  <p>5. Nüváktcomo (nüvák, snow; tcómo, mound). When the sun reaches here on
    its northern journey the Honáni or Badger people plant corn; the other
    Hopi people plant melons, squashes, and gourds.</p>

  <p>6. Pülhomotaka (pülü, round, hump; hómo, obscure; táka, man; possibly
    many hump-back men). When the sun reaches here the Pátki <span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>or Water
    people plant corn. When the sun returns here the Snake-Antelope
    fraternities assemble for the Snake dance.</p>

  <p>7. Kwitcála.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> When the sun rises at this point on his northward
    journey general planting begins, which continues until the summer
    solstice. When the sun returns to this point on his southerly journey
    the Nimánkatcina is celebrated.</p>

  <p>8. Taíovi (?).</p>

  <p>9. Owátcoki (owa, rock; tcóki, mound house).</p>

  <p>10. Wü′&NoBreak;nacakabi (wü′&NoBreak;na, pole; cáka, ladder).</p>

  <p>11. Wakácva, cattle spring, 12 miles north of Keams canyon.</p>

  <p>12. Paváukyaki, swallow house.</p>

  <p>13. Tüyüka, summer solstice.</p>

  <p>We are justified in accepting the theory that sun and moon<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
    worship is usual among primitive men. Whether that of the sun or
    of our satellite was the earlier it is not in the province of this
    article to discuss, but it is doubtless true that sun worship is a
    very ancient cult among most primitive peoples. The Pueblos are not
    exceptions, and while we can not say that their adoration is limited
    to the sun, it forms an essential element of their ritual, while their
    anhydrous environment has led them into a rain-cloud worship and other
    complexities. I think we can safely say, however, that the germ of
    their astronomy sprang from observations of the sun, and while yet in
    a most primitive condition they noticed the fact that this celestial
    body did not always rise or set at the same points on the horizon. The
    connection between these facts and the seasons of the year must have
    been noted early in their history, and have led to orientation, which
    plays such an important part in all their rituals. Thus the approach
    of the sun to a more vertical position in the sky in summer and its
    recession in winter led to the association of time when the earth
    yielded them their crops with its approach, and the time when the earth
    was barren with its recession. These epochs were noticed, however, not
    by the position of the sun at midday, but at risings and settings,
    or the horizon points. The two great epochs, summer and winter,
    were, it is believed, connected with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>solstitial amplitudes, and the
    equinoctial, horizontal points, unconnected with important times to
    agriculturists, were not considered as of much worth. There is every
    evidence, however, that the time of day was early indicated by the
    altitude of the sun, although the connection of the altitude at midday
    with the time of year was subordinated to observations on the horizon.</p>

  <h2 class="nobreak" id="CLASSIFICATION_OF_CEREMONIALS">CLASSIFICATION OF CEREMONIALS</h2>

  <p>In attempting to make out the annual cycle of ceremonial observances,
    as determined by observations made during the last three years, I
    recognize two groups, the differences between which may be more or less
    arbitrary. These groups are called—</p>

  <ol class="ml5 mt1 mb1" style="list-style-type:upper-roman">
    <li>The Katcinas.</li>
    <li>The Nine days’ ceremonials.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The former of these groups, which is the subject of this article,
    begins with the Katcinas’ return,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and ends with their departure
    (Nimán). It is not my purpose here to do more than refer to the latter
    group, as a short reference to them may be of value for a proper
    understanding of the Katcinas.</p>

  <p>There are significant likenesses between different members of the
    series of nine days’ ceremonials, and they may be grouped in several
    pairs, of which the following may be mentioned:</p>

  <ol class="ml5 mt1 mb1" style="list-style-type:upper-roman">
    <li>Snake or Flute.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></li>
    <li>Lálakoñti and Mamzraúti.</li>
    <li>Powámû and Pálülükoñti.</li>
    <li>Wüwütcímti and Naácnaiya.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The likenesses are built on the similarity of the rites practiced in
    both members of each pair. The Hopi priests recognize another kinship
    which does not appear in the nature of the ceremonies as much as in
    the subordinate parts. Thus, Lálakoñti and Pálülükoñti, Wüwütcímti
    and Mamzraúti are brother and sister ceremonials, according to their
    conceptions. This kinship is said to account for certain events in the
    ceremonials, and friendly feeling manifested between certain societies,
    but much obscurity envelops this whole subject of relationships.</p>

  <p>The term “Nine days’ ceremonies” refers to the active<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> ceremonial
    days, including those in which the chiefs perform the secret observance
    and the open dance of the last days. Strictly speaking, the ceremonial
    smoke to determine the time is a part of the observance, and from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>this
    date to the final public exhibition there are sixteen days, a multiple
    of the omnipresent number four.</p>

  <p>Some of the Katcinas have nine days of ceremonials, counting the
    assembly and the final purification.</p>

  <p>The inception of the ceremony is called tcótcoñ yüñya, smoking
    assembly, in which the chiefs (moñ′&NoBreak;mowitû) meet together in the evening
    at a prescribed house. The meeting places are as follows:</p>

  <table class="autotable" style="width: 90%;">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Tcütcüb (Snake-Antelope fraternity)</td>
        <td>Snake chief’s mother’s house.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mamzraú</td>

        <td>Nimán</td>
        <td>Kwümaletci’s.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>On the day following this smoke the speaker chief (tcaákmoñwi) at early
    sunrise announces to the public that the ceremony is to begin, and to
    the six direction deities (nananivo moñ′&NoBreak;mowitû) that the priests are
    about to assemble to pray for rain. Eight days after the announcement
    the chiefs gather in the kiva, and that day is called yüñya,
    assemblage, but is not counted in the sequence of ceremonial days. The
    first ceremonial day is Cüctála, after which follow the remaining days
    as already explained in my account of the Snake ceremonials. Counting
    the days from the commencement, the Snake, Flute, Nimán, Lálakoñti, and
    Mamzraúti are always celebrated in extenso sixteen days, or nine days
    of active ceremonies, as shown in articles elsewhere. When Naácnaiya
    is not celebrated, Wüwütcímti, Powámû, Soyáluña, and Pálülükoñti are
    abbreviated to four days of active ceremonials.</p>

  <p>The following diagnosis may be made of these great nine days’
    ceremonials: Duration of the ceremony, nine consecutive days and
    nights; no masked dancers in secret or public exhibitions; no Katcinas;
    no Tcukúwympkiyas.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Altars and sand mosaics generally present.
    Individual ceremonials either annual or biennial, but in either case at
    approximately the same time of the year; sequence constant. Típoni<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
    generally brought out in the public dance. Many páhos,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> ordinarily
    of different length (Snake, Flute, Lálakoñti, Mamzraúti), to deposit
    in shrines at varying distances from the town. Ceremonial racing,
    generally in the morning of the eighth and ninth days.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

  <p>The following are the important nine days’ ceremonies:</p>

  <p>1. The Antelope-Snake celebration, alternating biennially with the
    Lélenti or Flute observance.</p>

  <p>2. The Lálakoñti. This ceremony lasts nine days and as many nights,
    and is celebrated by women. The details of the celebration at Walpi in
    1891, together with the altars, fetiches, and the like have already
    been published.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It has some likenesses with the Mamzraúti, which
    follows it in sequence. There are four priestesses, the chief of whom
    is Kótcnümsi. Three típonis were laid on the altar in the celebration
    of 1891, although it is customary for each society to have but one
    típoni, which, with the other paraphernalia, is in the keeping of the
    chief priest.</p>

  <p>3. The Mamzraúti. This ceremonial has likewise been described.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In
    some celebrations of this festival girls appear with tablets on their
    heads personifying maids called Palahíkomanas. In 1891 these personages
    were represented by pictures<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of the same on slabs carried in the
    hands of girls. In this way the variations of their celebrations in
    different years may be explained; sometimes women are dressed to
    impersonate the Palahíkomanas, at others only pictures of the same are
    carried.</p>

  <p class="clear mt5"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>4. The Wüwütcímti. The Naácnaiya, of which this is an abbreviated
    observance, has been described.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> One of the most prominent events
    is the ceremonial making of the new fire; and as this is in a measure
    distinctive of these two, it is proper to designate them the New Fire
    ceremonies.</p>

  <p>In essentials the Naácnaiya and the Wüwütcímti are the same, but the
    former appears to be of less constant appearance and more complicated.
    In it, as elsewhere described, the statuette of Talátumsi is brought
    into the pueblo, but in the abbreviated form offerings are made at her
    shrine down the trail. During the making of the new fire Ánawita,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
    personifying Masauwûh, is hidden behind a blanket held by two
    assistants.</p>

  <p>The second group, called the Katcinas, which may be divided into two
    smaller divisions, known as the elaborate and the abbreviated, fills
    out the sequence of religious ceremonials between the Soyáluña and the
    Nimánkatcina. These celebrations are distinguished from those of the
    former group by the presence of masked personages to whom is given the
    name of Katcinas. By the use of these masks or helmets the participant
    is supposed to be transformed into the deity represented, and women and
    children avoid looking at Katcinas when unmasked. The main symbolism of
    the deity is depicted on the helmet or head, and varies in different
    presentations, but the remaining paraphernalia is constant, whatever
    personage is represented.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

  <p>The mask (kü′ĭtü, head) is often addressed as íkwatci, “my friend
    or double.” Prescriptively it must be put on and taken off with the
    left hand.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> It is of helmet shape, fitting closely to the head and
    resting on the shoulders. These masks or helmets are repainted at
    each presentation with the symbolism of the personage intended to be
    represented. They are ordinarily made of leather, portions of boot legs
    or saddles, and in one or two instances I have found on their inside
    the embossed or incised markings characteristic of Spanish saddles. Old
    felt hats are sometimes used in the manufacture of the simpler masks
    and those of the mud-heads are of coarse cloth. Few of the helmets now
    used give evidence of very great antiquity, although some are made of
    the skin of the bison. One can seldom purchase these helmets, as their
    manufacture is difficult, and instead of being discarded after use in
    one ceremony they are repainted for other presentations.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>

  <p>There is a similar uniformity year by year in the time of the
    celebration of the extended or elaborate Katcinas called Nimán,
    Powámû, Pálülükoñti, Soyáluña, and the Pa or Katcina’s return. Their
    sequence is always the same, but in the abbreviated Katcinas or masked
    dances this uniformity is not adhered to. A certain number of these
    are celebrated each spring and summer, but the particular abbreviated
    Katcina<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> which is presented varies from year to year, and may or may
    not be reproduced.</p>

  <p>While Katcinas or masked dances do not generally occur during the
    interval of the nine days’ ceremonials (autumn and early winter), I
    have notes on one of these which indicate that they sometimes take
    place in this epoch.</p>

  <p>On September 20, 1893, a Katcina called Áñakatcina<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> was performed
    in Hano after the Nimán had been celebrated in Walpi. Theoretically it
    would not be expected, as the farewell Katcina is universally said to
    be a celebration of the departure of these personages to their distant
    home, an event which does not occur at Hano. It would be strange if
    later observations should show that Katcinas are celebrated in other
    villages between the departure and return of these personages.</p>

  <h2 class="nobreak" id="DISCUSSION_OF_PREVIOUS_DESCRIPTIONS_OF_KATCINAS">DISCUSSION OF PREVIOUS DESCRIPTIONS OF KATCINAS</h2>

  <p>Our exact knowledge of the character of the Hopi Katcinas dates back to
    Schoolcraft’s valuable compilation. While the existence of these dances
    was known previously to that time, and several references to similar
    dances among the other Pueblos might be quoted from the writings of
    Spanish visitors, our information of the Katcina celebrations in
    Tusayan previously to 1852 is so fragmentary that it is hardly of
    value in comparative studies. In the year named Dr P. S. G. Ten Broeck
    visited Tusayan and published a description of what was probably a
    Katcina dance at Sitcomovi. Although his account is so imperfect that
    we can not definitely say what Katcina was personated, his description
    was the first important contribution to our knowledge of the character
    of these dances among the Hopi Indians. It will be noticed in a general
    way that the personation differed but slightly from those of the
    present day. Ten Broeck noted that the male dancers, Katcinas, wore
    on their heads “large pasteboard towers” <span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>(náktci?), and “visors<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
    made of small willows, with the bark peeled off and dyed a deep
    brown.” He recognized that the female dancers (Katcinamanas) were men
    dressed as women and that they wore yellow “visors” and dressed their
    hair in whorls as at the present time. He described the musical (?)
    accompaniment of the dance with the scapula of an animal rubbed over a
    “ground piece of wood.” He likewise noticed the priests who sprinkled
    the dancers with sacred meal, and speaks of two small boys painted
    black with white rings who accompanied the dance. The latter may have
    been personifications of the Little Fire Gods.</p>

  <p>The Hopi clowns, Tcukúwympkiyas, were likewise seen by Ten Broeck, who
    described their comical actions. From his description of the byplay of
    their “assistants,” I find very little change has taken place since his
    time. In the Katcina which he observed food was distributed during the
    dance, as I have elsewhere described is the case today. Although much
    might be added to Ten Broeck’s description, his observations were the
    most important which had been made known up to his time, and continued
    for forty years the most valuable record of this group<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> of dances
    among the Tusayan Indians.</p>

  <h2 class="nobreak" id="CLASSIFICATION_OF_KATCINAS">CLASSIFICATION OF KATCINAS</h2>

  <p>Before considering the various ceremonials in which the Katcinas
    appear, it may be well to say something of the nature of these
    supernatural beings which figure in them as made known by the testimony
    of some of the best-informed men of the tribe. The various legends
    which are told about them are numerous and can not be repeated here,
    but a few notions gathered from them may render it possible for the
    reader to better understand the character of the ceremonials in which
    they appear.</p>

  <p>These deities are generally regarded as animistic and subordinate to
    the greater gods.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> They have been called intercessors between man
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>and the highest supernatural beings. There are misty legends that
    long ago the Katcinas, like men, came from the under world and brought
    with them various charms or náhü with which the Hopi are familiar. By
    some it is said that a Honáni (Badger) chief came up from the Átkyaa,
    or under world, in the center of a square whose four sides were formed
    of lines of Katcinas, and that he bore in his left hand a buzzard
    wing feather and a bundle of medicine hats on his back. The Katcinas
    recognized him as their chief, and became Katcina Honáni, Badger
    Katcinas.</p>

  <p>The legend runs that in ancient times Hahaíwüqti<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> emerged from the
    under world followed by four sons, who were Katcinas, each bearing in
    his arms a pet called pálülükoñûh, plumed serpent. Following these four
    came other Katcinas with pets (pókomatü), of whom the following are
    mentioned:</p>

  <p>One bearing pákwa, frog (water-eagle).</p>

  <p>One bearing pátsro, water-bird.</p>

  <p>One bearing pawíkya, duck.</p>

  <p>One bearing pavákiyuta, water on the backs bearers, aquatic animals.</p>

  <p>One bearing yüñ′ocona, turtle.</p>

  <p>One bearing zrána, bullfrog.</p>

  <p>One bearing pavátiya, young water bearer (tadpole).</p>

  <p>The others with kwáhü (eagle), parrot, crow, cooper’s hawk, swallow,
    and night hawk.</p>

  <p>The Súmaíkoli pets for the six directions are:</p>

  <p>The first four Katcinas bear a startling yet foreign resemblance to
    the Navaho Etsuthçle.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The word pókomatü is difficult to translate,
    but “pets” seems a good rendering. Its usage is similar to that of
    certain Navaho words. A Navaho woman speaks of a favorite child as
    cili<sup>n</sup>; a man calls his pet horse cili<sup>n</sup>, and the shaman designates his
    fetich-emblem of a nature deity bĭli<sup>n</sup>; a Hopi calls his dog póko. The
    pet of Tuñwup is depicted on the altar as elsewhere mentioned in my

  <p>If there is any one feature which distinguishes a Katcina it is the use,
    by some or all of the participants, of a mask or ceremonial helmet. The
    Katcinas are divided into two groups, the complete and the abbreviated;
    the former is constant year by year, the latter varying. Altars
    are present in the complete, absent in abbreviated presentations.
    A cloud-charm altar or invocation to the six world-quarter deities
    is sometimes made. Public announcements are not prescribed. The
    Tcukúwympkiya or clowns are generally present. Abbreviated Katcinas
    consist mainly of public dances in which Katcinas, Katcinamanas, and
    clowns take part. The páhos or prayer offerings are few in number.
    Ceremony ends with a feast; generally no altars. Típoni<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> is not
    brought out in public. It is possible that the fox-skin so universally
    worn by the animistic personifications called Katcinas hanging from the
    belt behind, is a survival comparable with the skin of the animal in
    which formerly, as in Nahuatl ceremonials, the whole body was clothed.
    In the case of Natácka, for instance, a skin is still worn over the
    shoulders. Conservatism in dress is tenaciously adhered to in religious
    paraphernalia among all peoples.</p>

  <p>Roughly speaking we may say that the Katcina celebrations are
    characterized by the presence of the Tcukúwympkiyas (Tatcükti,
    Tcückütû, Paikyamû or clowns), which do not appear in the unmasked
    or nine days’ ceremonials. The epoch in which they remain among the
    Hopi is therefore approximately that from the winter to the summer
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>solstices; that in which they are absent, from the summer to the
    winter solstices.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

  <p>I classify the Katcina celebrations into two large groups, which may be
    called the elaborate and the abbreviated, and have considered them in
    the following pages.</p>

  <h4 id="SOYALUNA">SOYÁLUÑA</h4>

  <p>The celebration in the December moon has not as yet been described,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
    but a large body of material relating thereto is in my hands. In
    order to give a general idea of its character a brief outline of a
    characteristic portion of it is inserted in this place. Soyáluña is
    distinctly a warriors’ observance, and has been called the Return
    Katcina. In one sense it may be so designated, but more strictly it
    is the return of the War god, regarded as a leader of the gods, and
    in that recalls the Nahuatl Teotleco, as elsewhere pointed out. The
    singing of the night songs of the warriors is one of the most effective
    archaic episodes of the ceremonial of the winter solstice.</p>

  <p>In the following account a description of a few events in the
    celebration of 1891 is introduced:</p>

  <p>On the <abbr title="22nd">22d</abbr> of December of that year most of the men of the villages
    prepared cotton strings, to the end of which they tied feathers and
    piñon needles. These were given away during the day to different
    persons, some receiving from one to two dozen, which they tied in
    their hair. When a maker of these feathered strings presented one to
    a friend, he said, as translated, “Tomorrow all the Katcinas to you
    grant your wishes,” holding his bundle vertically and moving it with
    a horizontal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span> motion. At nightfall each man procured a willow wand
    from 3 to 4 feet long and looped upon it all the strings which he had
    received. He then carried his stick to the Móñkiva and placed it in the
    rafters, thus imparting to the ceiling the appearance of a bower of
    feathers and piñon needles.</p>

  <p>All the kivas were meeting places of the participants, but the
    Tátaukyamû met at the Móñkiva, where the principal festivities
    took place. Their chief wore a head-dress decorated with symbols
    of rain-clouds (plate <a href="#CVIII"><span class="allsmcap"><abbr title="108">CVIII</abbr></span></a>), and carried a shield upon
    which was depicted the sun (plate <a href="#CIV"><span class="allsmcap"><abbr title="104">CIV</abbr></span></a>). The chief of a
    second society carried a shield upon which was drawn a star (plate
    <a href="#CIV"><span class="allsmcap"><abbr title="104">CIV</abbr></span></a>), and a third chief bore a shield with an antelope drawn
    upon it. The head-dress of the chief of the Aáwympkiya was adorned
    with glistening triplex horns, and on his shield was represented an
    unknown Katcina (plate <a href="#CIV"><span class="allsmcap"><abbr title="104">CIV</abbr></span></a>). The fifth society was Kwákwantû,
    or warrior, whose chief carried in his hand an effigy of the great
    snake (Pálülükoñûh) which was carved from the woody stalk of the agave
    (kwan), from which the society was named. He came from the Tcivato-kiva
    and on his shield was depicted a Kwákwantû in full costume. The sixth
    society was the Tatcü′&NoBreak;kti or “knobbed heads;” their shield-bearer wore
    a head-dress like a coronet, while on his shield was drawn a black
    figure with lozenge-shape eyes. The shield of the chief of the seventh
    society was adorned with a picture of the Táwamoñwi or sun chief.</p>

  <p>After the societies had entered the kiva an invocation to the cardinal
    points was chanted, and the shield-bearers, in turn, standing over the
    sípapû, stamped on it. At a signal the society arranged itself into
    two irregular groups, one on the north, the other on the south side
    of the main floor. All then vehemently burst forth into a song, the
    shield-bearer making eccentric dashes among his associates, first to
    one side and then to the other.</p>

  <p>While the song lasted the shield-bearer continued these short, swift
    rushes, and the assembled groups crouched down and met his dashes by
    rising and driving him back to the sípapû. He madly oscillated from
    right to left, that is, from the north to the south side of the room,
    and swung his shield in rhythm, while those near him beat their feet in
    time. The shield was dashed from face to face, and the groups made many
    motions as if to seize it, but no one did more than to touch it with
    outstretched hands. The movements on both sides were highly suggestive
    of attack and defense.</p>

  <p>At 8 p. m. about one dozen men were collected in the Móñkiva, among
    whom was Lésma playing a flageolet. The hatchway was guarded by a
    tyler, and for a nátci there was placed there a wicker skullcap
    ornamented with a pair of imitation mountain-sheep horns (plate
    <a href="#CX"><span class="allsmcap"><abbr title="110">CX</abbr></span></a>), Two hours later the room was densely packed with naked
    men, their bodies undecorated, wearing small eagle plumes attached to
    the crown of the head. Two women were present. Anawíta, chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span> of the
    Kwákwantû, sat alone on the southern side of the main floor which was
    clear in the middle, and twelve chiefs, among them Címo, Súpela, and
    Tcubéma, sat opposite him.</p>

  <p>Ten novices from the other kivas entered gorgeously arrayed in white
    kilts, brilliant crowns of feathers, white body decorations, bearing
    an imitation squash blossom, with spruce sprigs in their left hands
    and corn in their right hands. As the chiefs took their places Lésma
    sprinkled the floor of the room near the ladder with moist valley sand,
    about an inch deep. The novices stepped from the ladder upon this sand
    and passed up in front of the chiefs, then squatted before them facing
    the south, their kilts having been lifted so that they sat on the cold
    floor.</p>

  <p>Anawíta then crossed over to the south side of the room and seated
    himself at the east end of the line of chiefs.</p>

  <p>At the west wall of the kiva a strange altar had been erected. Lésma
    had piled against the ledge of this part of the kiva a stack of corn,
    two or more ears of which had been contributed by the maternal head of
    each family in the pueblo. At either side and in front of the stack of
    corn shrubbery had been placed. In the space between the top of the
    corn pile and the roof wands were placed, and to these wands had been
    fastened many artificial flowers, 4 or 5 inches in diameter, set close
    together but in no regular lines. There were over 200 of these flowers
    of different colors, dark-red and white predominating. Nearly in the
    center of this artificial shrubbery there was a large gourd shell with
    the convex side turned toward the audience and having an aperture
    about 8 inches in diameter in its center. Through this opening had
    been thrust the head of an effigy<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> of Pálülükoñûh, the plumed-head
    snake, painted black, with a tongue-like appendage protruding from the
    mouth. When all the assembled priests were seated a moment of solemn
    stillness ensued, after which Súpela arose, cast a handful of meal
    toward the effigy of the snake, and said a short prayer in a reverent
    tone.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Then the head of the snake, which was manipulated by an
    unseen person behind the altar, was observed to rise slowly to the
    center of the aperture, and a mellow sounding roar like a blast through
    a conch appeared to come from the mouth, while the whole head was made
    to quiver and wave. The sound was of short duration, repeated four
    times, and then the head reposed again on the lower rim of the ground
    shell. Presently was heard a sound as of a scapula drawn across a
    notched stick six times. All the old chiefs in succession cast meal to
    the effigy and prayed, and in response to each the great snake emitted
    sounds identical with those mentioned above. The spectators then left
    the kiva, and a frenzied dance of strange character occurred. The
    societies from other kivas came in, and the chief of each declaimed in
    a half-chanting voice which rose to a shriek at the close of a stanza.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>First, he drew back to the fireplace, and then with a shuffling gait
    approached the symbolic opening in the floor called the sípapû.</p>

  <p>Anawíta then shouted at the top of his voice, and the shuffler sprang
    in the air and vaulted over the sípapû. Then everybody in the room
    shouted loudly and a song in concert followed. A moment later the
    visiting societies dashed down the ladder, each bearing a splendid
    shield ornamented with the figure of the sun and a rim of radiating
    eagle feathers. Each society had its distinctive sun shield, which on
    entering was handed to the chief. As he received it he stamped on the
    sípapú and a fierce song was sung. Meanwhile two members of the society
    stood apart from their fellows against the southern wall facing each
    other, each holding a squash flower emblem in a bouquet of spruce twigs
    and an ear of corn in his left hand.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the fifteen or twenty members of the society drew back from
    their chief, who then sprang upon the sípapû plank, and quickly turning
    faced them as all burst forth in an ecstatic shouting, with wild
    flinging of their arms as they approached the shield-bearers. They
    naturally formed two clusters, and as the shield-bearer dashed his
    shield in their faces they surged back, to leap again toward him. This
    seeming assault, wild though it appeared, was maintained in time with
    the song. The two chieftains joined their men, all in ecstatic frenzy,
    and one of them, shaking his shield, sprang from right to left, drawing
    back his assistants in rhythm with the beating of the feet of all on
    the floor. After a few moments of most exhaustive movements some of the
    weaker staggered up the ladder, and shortly after one of the chiefs
    fell fainting to the floor, overcome by exhaustion and the intense
    heat of the room. One splendid athlete danced with vigor for fully
    five minutes, and then swept toward the ladder where the assistant
    was standing in readiness to receive his shield. Another stride and
    he reached the foot of the ladder and suddenly became as rigid as
    a corpse. The men who belonged to the Móñkiva took no part in this
    exhaustive dance but stood in readiness to carry those who fainted up
    the ladder to the cool air outside.</p>

  <p>It has been suggested that this assault of the men on the bearer of
    the sun shield dramatizes the attack of hostile powers on the sun, and
    that the object is to offset malign influences or to draw back the sun
    from a disappearance suggested by its southern declination.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> In
    this possible interpretation it is well to consider that immediately
    preceding it the archaic offerings and prayers to the great snake
    were made, as described, in the presence of spectators. The idea of
    hostility of the great snake to the sun is an aboriginal American
    conception. In the Maya Codex Cortesianus (33<i>b</i>) the plumed snake
    is represented<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>as swallowing the sun as in an eclipse. If Soyáluña
    is a propitiatory ceremony to prevent the destruction or disappearance
    of the sun in winter or to offset the attacks of hostile malevolent
    deities upon him, we can see a possible explanation of the attacks and
    defenses of the sun as here dramatized.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The evil influences of the
    great snake are met by the prayers to his effigy; the attacks of other
    less powerful deities are dramatized in the manner indicated.</p>

  <p>The following contains a few suggestions in regard to the character of
    the dramatization in the December celebration. In the prayers to the
    Plumed Snake his hostility was quieted, and the chiefs did what they
    could to propitiate that powerful deity, who was the great cause of
    their apprehension that the beneficent sun (Táwa) would be overcome.
    Then followed the dramatization of the conflict of opposing powers,
    possibly representing other deities hostile to our beneficent father,
    the sun. Although the struggle involved, so far as the participants
    were concerned, their highest powers of endurance and bodily suffering,
    the sun-shield or symbol of Táwa had the good fortune to resist the
    many assaults made upon it.</p>

  <p>The introduction of dramatization as an explanation of the warrior
    celebration is theoretic, therefore not insisted upon, and is at least
    plausible until a better interpretation is suggested. It has in its
    support the evidence drawn from a comparative study of ceremonials. In
    the light of this theory the return and departure of the Katcina has a
    new significance, and may be regarded as a modified sun myth. At the
    winter solstice the sun and his attendant deities have reached their
    most distant point, and turned to come back to the pueblos. In the
    mid-summer the solar deity approached them; he was near them, and in
    appreciation of this fact, which means blessings, the poor Hopi made
    his offering;<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> danced the Snake dance, asking the snake to bring the
    rain, believing he was no longer hostile or at enmity with the sun. But
    the withdrawal of the gods (Farewell Katcinas) could not be delayed by
    these rites, and the sun each day drew farther from them. The Katcinas
    (gods) departed; the bright, beneficent summer gave place to cold,
    dreary winter; life was replaced by death. In this most critical epoch
    the warriors, the most potent human powers of the pueblo, performed
    their ceremony to bring back the beneficent god and his train. The
    Nahuatl priest called a similar ceremony “Teotleco,” the god comes—“The
    dead god is reborn,” says Duran. The gods (Katcinas) come, say the Hopi
    (Soyáluña, all assemblage; derived from co, all; yuñya, assemblage).
    The Nahuatl priest sprinkled meal on the floor of the teocalli, and
    when he saw in the meal the footprint <span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>of the War god, the leader of
    the divinities, he announced the fact. The Hopi priest still continues
    to sprinkle sand on the kiva floor during the ceremony.</p>

  <h4 id="KATCINAS_RETURN">KATCINA’S RETURN</h4>

  <p>The first celebration of the Katcinas in the spring, several months
    after their departure,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> took place in that division of the year
    called the Pamüyawû,and is known as Mohti Katcínumyüñya, or “First
    Katcina assembly.” I have called it the Return Katcina. It follows
    directly after the winter páho making of the Snake-Antelope or Flute
    societies, which varies in character according to whether the Snake or
    the Flute society gives the presentation that year. In 1893 it followed
    the Snake páho making, and in 1894 that of the Flute. It may be called
    a composite, abbreviated assembly of Katcinas.</p>

  <p>During the day Katcina masks were renovated in the kivas of the mesa,
    and there were visitations at all the kivas by the personators in
    the coming celebration. Women and children crowded the spectators’
    quarters of these rooms, and the performances lasted from 10 oclock in
    the evening until 2 oclock of the following morning. Previously to the
    exhibition in the kivas, men personating different Katcinas visited
    the following points to make hómoya or meal offerings and to say
    appropriate prayers:</p>

  <p>On the 24th of this month (Pa), as after the Snake ceremonials,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> the
    Nüitiwa, or struggles of the maids with the men for bowls, etc., took
    place, except that in this instance it was a struggle with a Katcina
    and not, as in the Snake observance, between girls and young men.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

  <p>From the foregoing table we learn that in the Return Katcina for 1894
    the following<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> were personified:</p>

  <ol class="ml10 mt1">
    <li>Kütca (white) aña.</li>
    <li>Coyóhim.</li>
    <li>Tcakwaína.</li>
    <li>Pópkotu.</li>
    <li>Mucaízru.</li>
    <li>Hü′iki.</li>
    <li>Hehéa.</li>
    <li>Avátchoya.</li>
    <li>Tacáb.</li>
    <li> Humís.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The accompanying clowns were the Tatcü′kti or knob-head priests. It is
    an interesting fact that in the celebration of the departure of the
    Katcinas the clowns took no part, but these priests were important
    additions to the Síocálako.</p>

  <p>The celebration of the Return Katcina, which occurs in the winter
    Pa moon, is accompanied by elaborate rites performed by either the
    Snake-Antelope or the Flute fraternity, the society observing it being
    that which will give its celebration in the summer Pa moon of the same
    year. A description of these rites naturally falls in an account of the
    group of unmasked dances. They extend over several days and appear to
    be wholly distinct from the celebration of the Return Katcina. While
    these are being performed in the “upper world,” the complemental Flute
    or Snake observances are supposed to be taking place in the “under
    world,” where the summer Pa moon then reigns. Precisely the same
    relationship is thought to exist between the two as that between the
    seasons of the north and south temperate zones.</p>

  <p>This ceremony is one of the most elaborate in which the Katcinas
    appear, and for want of a better name may be designated a
    renovation<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> or purification observance. In the year 1893 it took
    place near the close of January and continued for nine days, and in a
    previous<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> article I have mentioned and figured the most striking
    personages, the monsters or Natáckas, who appear in its presentation
    (plates <a href="#CV"><span class="allsmcap"><abbr title="105">CV</abbr></span></a>, <a href="#CVI"><span class="allsmcap"><abbr title="106">CVI</abbr></span></a>, <a href="#CXI"><span class="allsmcap"><abbr title="111">CXI</abbr></span></a>). There are, however,
    certain other personages new to students of Tusayan ceremonials who
    are introduced, and I have therefore thought it well to describe the
    presentation in extenso.</p>

  <p>The details of this ceremony in 1893 were as follows:<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

  <p><i>January 20</i>—Early this morning Hoñyi went to all the kivas and
    formally announced that the ceremony was soon to begin. There was
    no public announcement, as no Katcina celebration is made known in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>this way, and the Katcinas must not be spoken of in public. Íntiwa
    and Pauwatíwa began making páhos in the Móñkiva without preliminary
    ceremony at about 9 a. m., and fifteen other priests removed the masks
    and redecorated them, after having scraped off the old paint remaining
    from other ceremonials.</p>

  <p>All the masks were finished about 7 p. m., after which Suñoitiwa and
    the other elders brought fox-skins and other paraphernalia into the
    kiva, where Kwátcakwa, Kópeli, Tcábi, Kákapti, and four or five other
    men began to decorate their bodies with pigment, using a pale-red iron
    oxide (cúta) on their legs, knees, and waists. They daubed the whole
    upper leg above the knee with a white pigment, and drew two lines
    across the shins, the fore and upper arms, and on each side of the
    chest and abdomen. The entrance into the katcínaki, or paraphernalia
    closet, was open while this took place.</p>

  <p>The masks were all ornamented with large clusters of feathers. They
    were tied to the head with a loose loop across the top which slipped
    over the crown where the plumage rested, and there were strings at the
    sides of the mask by which they were attached. The body was ornamented
    with ribbons, red flannel, and other articles of white man’s make,
    which are innovations.</p>

  <p>Kwátcakwa, who later personated a Tcukúwympkiya, drew a broad band
    of white clay across his shins, thighs, arms, and body. A great wisp
    of cornhusks was tied in his hair, which was all brought forward and
    coiled over the forehead. The others donned their kilts, necklaces,
    turquoise eardrops, and moccasins. Each one wore a fox-skin hanging
    tail downward at the loins, and on the left leg below the knee a string
    of bells, while the majority had garters of blue yarn. Their hair,
    which was first bound in long cues, wrapped high with strings, was
    later loosened, hanging in a fine fluffy mass.</p>

  <p>Sakwístiwa, who was the púcücütoi or drummer, wore pantaloons held up
    by a belt of silver disks, and a grotesque mask. All left the kiva
    immediately after their disguises were completed and assembled in the
    Móñkiva court.</p>

  <p>Íntiwa hurriedly but thoroughly swept the floor of the chamber, during
    which time a number of women and children came down the ladder, filling
    the spectators’ part of the room. The assembled group of Katcinas
    prayed and then went out, but about fifteen minutes later returned
    to the kiva entrance and shook their rattles at the hatchway. “Yuñya
    ai,” “come, assemble,” said the old men, and the women invited them to
    come down, which they did. Kwátcakwa, who personated the Nüvákkatcina,
    entered, followed by ten others. They assembled in a semicircle, each
    with a rattle in the right hand and a spruce bough in the left, Íntiwa
    sprinkled with meal all who came, after which they performed a dance,
    in which, however, their leader did not join.</p>

  <p>Before they finished a band of ten men, disguised as Paiutes, carrying
    bows and arrows, rabbits, and small game which they wished to trade,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
    came to the hatchway. They had a drummer with a Paiute drum, made of
    a bundle of skins wrapped in an oblong package, on which he beat with
    a stick held in both hands. The persons performed a dance, which they
    accompanied with a song. They likewise talked, cracked jokes, and
    presented the rabbits to the assembled women.</p>

  <p>After them there came others from the Nacabkiva, each with a crook in
    the left hand and a rattle in the right. These wore grotesque masks,
    one representing an old woman with a long crooked staff in her hand.
    Their bodies were whitened and they wore saddle-mat kilts around their
    loins and tortoise rattles on the right leg. They sang a very spirited
    song, shaking their rattles as they advanced. These were six in number
    and were called the Powámûkatcinas. Directly after them there came a
    band of Tatcü′kti, who sang and danced on the roof of the kiva. The old
    men within repeatedly invited them to enter the room, and a dialogue
    of some length ensued. Their leader carried a large basket tray in
    which were four cones made of wood and each mud-head had in his hand
    a wooden rod and an eagle leather. The leader placed the cones in the
    middle of the floor in a pile, one above the other, near the fireplace.
    The others danced around the pile, roaring a song with much dramatic
    action, and heaped up ears of corn in the tray.</p>

  <p>They then brought a young married woman from those assembled to the
    middle of the floor, where she knelt and tried without success to lift
    the cones as high as the staff which the leader held beside them. Four
    or five other women tried in turn, and all failed. The mud-heads then
    divided the cones into two piles and one of the women lifted them the
    required height. All the Tatcü′kti<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> then fell down on the floor and
    kicked their heels in the air, while certain of them stood on their
    heads for a minute or two. The woman who was successful in lifting the
    cones received the contents of the tray. The Tatcü′kti then left the
    room and the Katcinas returned and unmasked, indicating that this part
    of the ceremony was over.</p>

  <p><i>January 21</i>—During last night there were ceremonials which were
    not seen in the Móñkiva, in which it was said the Ahü′&NoBreak;lkatcina made
    parallel marks in meal on the four sides of the kiva and upon the
    ceiling and floor as in the Mamzraúti and other ceremonials. A basin
    with sprouting beans, which had been planted at the full of the Pamüiya
    or Pa moon (January 2) and which were about a foot high, was brought
    from one of the houses opposite the Tcívatokiva. The beans, which were
    growing in a basin, were plucked from the sand, tied into a separate
    bundle, and given to Ahü′&NoBreak;lkatcina. A large squirrel-skin was filled
    with meal and given to him, and he was handed also a wooden staff
    (móñkohu). The large discoidal mask characteristic of this personage
    had a pouch-like attachment of buckskin which was pulled over the head,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>upon which was a large cluster of feathers. A white kilt was worn as a
    cape and the skin of a gray fox hung from the girdle at his loins.
  </p>

  <p>At daylight Ahü′lktacina and Íntiwa returned, passing the gap (Wala)
    and halting at the pahóki (shrine<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>) to deposit certain nakwákwocis
    and páhos. Just as the sun rose the two visited a kiva in Hano.
    Stooping down in front of it, Ahü′l drew a vertical mark with meal
    on the inside of the front of the hatchway, on the side of the
    entrance opposite the ladder. He turned to the sun and made six silent
    inclinations, after which, standing erect, he bent his head backward
    and began a low rumbling growl, and as he bent, his head forward,
    raised his voice to a high falsetto. The sound he emitted was one
    long expiration, and continued as long as he had breath. This act he
    repeated four times and, turning toward the hatchway, made four silent
    inclinations, emitting the same four characteristic expiratory calls.
    The first two of these calls began with a low growl, the other two were
    in the same high falsetto from beginning to end.</p>

  <p>The kiva chief and two or three other principal members, each carrying
    a handful of meal, then advanced, bearing short nakwákwoci hotomni,
    which they placed in his left hand while they muttered low, reverent
    prayers. They received in return a few stems of the corn and bean
    plants which Ahü′l carried.</p>

  <p>Ahü′l and Íntiwa next proceeded to the house of Tetapobi,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> who
    is the only representative of the Bear clan in Hano. Here at the
    right-hand side of the door Ahü′l pressed his hand full of meal
    against the wall at about the height of his chest and moved his hand
    upward.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> He then, as at the kiva, turned around and faced the
    sun, holding his staff vertically at arm’s length with one end on
    the ground, and made six silent inclinations and four calls. Turning
    then to the doorway he made four inclinations and four calls. He then
    went to the house of Nampíyo’s mother, where the same ceremony was
    performed, and so on to the houses of each man or woman of the pueblo
    who owns a típoni or other principal wími (fetich).</p>

  <p>He repeated the same ceremony in houses in Sitcomovi and in Walpi,
    where Íntiwa left him. Ahü′l entered this pueblo by the north street
    and passed through the passageway to the Móñkiva. He proceeded to the
    houses of Kwumawumsi, Nasyúñwewe, Samiwiki, and to all the kivas and
    the houses of all the leading chiefs.</p>

  <p>After visiting all the kivas and appropriate houses mentioned above,
    Ahü′l went to Kowawainovi (the ledge under Talatryuku) and deposited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
    in the pahóki all the offerings that he had received, after which he
    returned to the Móñkiva, divested himself of his ceremonial disguises,
    and went home.</p>

  <p>At 2 p. m. the Nüvák (snow) Katcinas came from the Nacabki, led by
    Soyóko. They were nine in number and were accompanied by a drummer. All
    wore bright plumage on their heads and their masks were painted green
    and white, but that of the drummer was pink. They were adorned with
    many necklaces, and wore white kilts and gray fox-skins. Yellow stripes
    were painted on the shoulders, the forearm, on each breast and the
    abdomen, and the bodies of all were stained red.</p>

  <p>After singing and dancing for about five minutes, nine clowns
    (Tatcü′kti) came from the Álkiva and danced madly around the court, at
    first independently, but finally keeping step with the Katcinas. They
    joined in line one behind the other, each grasping the uplifted leg of
    the man in front of him, and then tumbled pell-mell over one another,
    shouting and laughing as they did so.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

  <p>At 2.20 a personification of Tcavaíyo, arrayed in a conical black mask
    with globular eyes and great teeth, entered the kiva. He carried a bow
    and arrows in his left hand and a saw in his right. His forearms and
    legs were painted black with white spots. This monster dispersed the
    clowns, during which many Zuñi words were uttered.</p>

  <p>At 2.50 the Katcinas again returned and repeated their former dance in
    the same way as described. The antics of the Tatcü′kti continued, and
    the Katcinas appeared again at 4.20 p. m.; then later at 5, when they
    all departed, not to return. When the Katcinas retired to Wikyátiwa’s
    house at 4 oclock the clowns went down into the Álkiva and returned
    in their characteristic procession, the drummer in front, the other
    eight in two lines of four persons. Each carried on his back a large
    bundle composed of a fine blanket, cotton cloth, yarn, and all kinds
    of textile articles of value. One also had the four cones which they
    had used the night before and a tray of shelled corn of all colors,
    mixed with various kinds of seeds. They laid the tray in the center
    of the court and spread a blanket beside it, on which they placed
    all their bundles. One of their number then piled the cones, one on
    top of another, and while he was doing this the drummer rapidly beat
    his drum, while the others shook their rattles and sung vigorously.
    When the cones had been set up one of the men sought out a girl and
    brought her to them and told her if she would take hold of the lowest
    cone with both hands, raise the pile, and set it back in place without
    letting any of the cones fall she should have all the wealth piled on
    the blanket. But the least jar tumbled the cones down, and each one of
    the half dozen or more girls to whom they made the same offer failed
    in turn. Then they invited the youths to try, and several essayed, but
    none were able to perform the feat. So the prize, doubtless designedly,
    was left in the original owner’s hands. They then brought a blanket
    full of hoyiani <span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>and placed the cones in two piles, but even then
    none of the girls succeeded in carrying it. No one was allowed a second
    trial. Finally one youth, Macakwáptiwa, carried them around safely
    and won the prize. He was closely followed around the pillar by the
    Tatcü′kti shaking their rattles, singing and crying, “Don’t fall, don’t
    fall,” and when he laid them safely down in their original place all
    the Tatcü′kti fell down as if dead. Íntiwa then ran and obtained ashes
    from a cooking pit and placed them on a private part of their bodies.
    Then all the clowns got up and danced around with their usual pranks.</p>

  <p>A tray full of corn and other seeds which was set beside the cones was
    obtained by the Tatcü′kti from Nakwaíyumsi, the chief priestess of the
    Katcina clan. At the close of the ceremony Íntiwa distributed these
    seeds in small handfuls to all the women spectators, to be planted the
    coming season. It was not learned that these seeds were consecrated by
    the priestess, but they were part of those planted in the kivas on the
    night of the 21st.</p>

  <p><i>January 22</i>—The younger men brought sand from a mound<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and
    threw it down in a pile at the east of the kiva, and each man, as he
    came into the room with his basin, box, or other receptacle, filled it
    with this sand. He then thickly sprinkled the surface of the sand with
    seeds of every kind. Some had several vessels which they thus planted,
    and the old wife of Soyóko gave her grandson a bag of large white beans
    to plant for her.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The basins were well watered, a hot fire was
    kept in the kiva, and the hatch or entrance was entirely covered with
    a straw mat to retain the heat in the chamber, making it a veritable
    hothouse.</p>

  <p><i>January 24</i>—No ceremonies occurred today, but constant fires
    were maintained in the kivas, from the heat of which the beans soon
    sprouted. It was understood that children must not be told that beans
    were growing in the kivas nor be allowed to look into the room.</p>

  <p><i>January 25</i>—The Tatcü′kti went out from the Álkiva this morning
    for wood, making their way northward, past Wala and along the mesa to
    the cedar grove. They returned at evening, but left the wood they had
    gathered at the gap.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> There was no singing nor dancing in the kivas
    during the night.</p>

  <p><i>January 26</i>—During the morning the Tatcü′kti went to Wala to
    bring in the wood they had collected yesterday. Before their departure
    they covered their bodies with pinkish clay, put on an old kilt
    (kwáca),<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> blue leggings, and masks with knobs. Each carried an
    eagle-tail feather in the left and a small gourd in the right hand.
    They <span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>returned along the trail, marching in single file, with the loads
    of wood on their backs, stamping their feet as they came. They likewise
    shook their rattles and occasionally turned and walked backward.</p>

  <p>They first assembled around each of the kiva hatchways in Hano, singing
    and chaffing one another, and were sprinkled with meal by the kiva
    chiefs. Proceeding onward to Sitcomovi, they went to the entrances of
    the kivas of this pueblo and were there sprinkled with meal by the
    chiefs as they sang their curious songs, accompanying them with a
    stamping of the feet and a rotating movement of the body. It was after
    1 oclock when they arrived at Walpi, for they halted a short time at
    the neck of the mesa to arrange their loads. As they entered the pueblo
    they advanced along the south street singing as they went.</p>

  <p>At the entrance to Tcívatokiva they stopped and told Pauwatíwa a
    facetious story of their wood-gathering. He sprinkled them with meal,
    and they then went on to the dance court and set down their bundles,
    all the time making a droll byplay. They then separated into parties
    of two or three members and visited the houses of several women, with
    whom they left one or more bundles of wood. These women had previously
    prepared nakwákwocis, which they gave to the clowns with a handful of
    meal.</p>

  <p>After all the wood had been distributed, with much rollicking fun,
    several women gave them food, and the small parties of Tatcü′kti
    resumed their songs and marched through the dance court, where they
    all assembled. One of them was a drummer, who sat in the middle of the
    court, and the others danced about him in a circle, singing a Zuñi
    song. Pauwatíwa, Íntiwa, Tcósra, and Soyóko sprinkled them with meal,
    and the first-mentioned invited the women who had been given wood to
    approach, which they did, sprinkling the individual Tatcü′ktis with
    meal. Their masks were then harshly removed and thrust into a bag, tied
    up in a bundle, and carried to the house of Wikyátiwa. Most of the food
    which they had received was carried down into the Álkiva, which was the
    assemblage place of the Tatcü′kti in this ceremony.</p>

  <p>In all the kivas the beans had sprouted and were now called házrü
    (angular), possibly so named from the angle formed by the cotyledons
    with the stem. When they had grown somewhat higher they were called
    wupáhazrü (great or long, angular).</p>

  <p><i>January 28</i>—No ceremonials were observed on this day.</p>

  <p><i>January 29</i>—This was called the first ceremonial day of the
    Powámuh. About 11 oclock last night the Natácka donned their masks in
    the Álkiva, and the man who took the part of Hahaíwüqti, the mother
    of the Natáckas, put on her disguise and took her long juniper bough.
    Háhawe went up the ladder, standing on it with his shoulders just above
    the hatchway, while the mother of the monsters stood at the foot of
    the same in the room. Assuming a hollow falsetto voice, in which the
    mother of the Natáckas always speaks, she announced that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span> she was ready
    to visit the children. Háhawe shouted his replies to her in a voice
    audible through the pueblo that the children were all asleep and that
    she had better put off her visit to them until the morning. A dialogue,
    the real object of which was to announce to the children that the
    Natáckas had arrived, was maintained for five minutes, and Háhawe then
    went down the ladder; the Natáckas and Hahaíwüqti took off their masks
    and all laid down to sleep.</p>

  <p>About 4.20 p. m. the Tewa personification of Hahaíwüqti, accompanied
    by one Natácka, came to Walpi and went to Kókyanwü′qti’s and Kele’s
    houses, giving to the little girls a few seeds and a snare of yucca
    shred. They dressed the Walpi Hahaíwüqti, Natáckas, and Soyókmana in
    the Álkiva at 4.25 p. m. Hahaíwüqti carried, besides a whitened gourd
    ladle, a basket (póota) containing two ears of corn, and two boiled
    hoyíani, some squash seeds, and a small bundle of sticks, of which she
    gave one to each little girl, who will later redeem it by presenting
    Hahaíwüqti with some hótomni. She gave each little boy, who will also
    redeem it with some kinds of game, a shred of yucca looped to a stick
    at the butt end (a rude snare). Natácka and Náamû wore cloth shirts,
    trousers and buckskin leggings, and two buckskins hung as loose mantles
    over their shoulders. The former carried a tortoise-shell rattle on
    his right leg, and had a bow and arrows in his left hand and an arrow
    in the right. Soyókmana had the hair smeared with white clay. She
    wore a loose mantle and whistled as Natácka hooted. Hahaíwüqti wore a
    fox-skin around the neck. The hands of all were whitened. Soyókmana
    wore a hideous black mask and was dressed in dilapidated clothing. She
    had a large knife in her left hand and a crook in her right (plates
    <a href="#CV"><span class="allsmcap"><abbr title="105">CV</abbr></span></a> and <a href="#CVI"><span class="allsmcap"><abbr title="106">CVI</abbr></span></a>).</p>

  <p>The Natácka helmets had turkey-tail feathers<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> closely radiating
    vertically at the crown, and they wore a cloth shirt and trousers, with
    belt with silver disks. Each had buckskin leggings and wore a fox-skin
    around the base of the mask; two large buckskins hung as mantles over
    the right shoulder. He carried a bow and arrows<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> in the left hand
    and with his right hand he received the food and placed it in the
    tozrúki<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> slung over his right shoulder. Soyókmana was personified
    by a lad of 12 years, wearing a woman’s blanket (kwáca) and a buckskin
    mantle. He had a nakwákwoci, stained red, tied to the scalp lock.</p>

  <p>A similar group, all costumed identically, was prepared in each of the
    three villages. The group of Tewa personifications went to every house
    in that pueblo and then to the houses in other villages where men from
    Hano have married. The groups of the other towns go first to the houses
    of their own pueblo and then to the houses in the other villages where
    men have transferred themselves by marriage.</p>

  <p>When the Walpi group had finished their exercises at Hano and Sitcomovi
    they went back to Walpi and proceeded along the front side of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>their
    pueblo to their own kiva, where they disrobed about dark. The object
    of the exhibition was to frighten children who exhibited fear of them,
    but children 6 years of age or thereabouts were somewhat familiar with
    them, and while it was evident they held the monsters in considerable
    awe they tried to assume a bold front when receiving the seeds and
    snares.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

  <p>At 8.30 a man personifying Tümáckatcina ran through Walpi from the
    Móñkiva toward Wala, emitting hoots as he went. A full half hour
    after, about 9 oclock, a group of masked but uncostumed men wrapped in
    blankets went to the kiva hatches and uttered most ferocious groans for
    four or five minutes. This was done in an informal manner, but was said
    to be prescribed ceremonially.</p>

  <p><i>January 30</i>—Between 7 and 8 oclock Wikokuitkatcina emerged from
    the Álkiva, passed around Walpi to the east end of the pueblo, and then
    down through the north lane, past Íntiwa’s house, under the passageways
    back to the Álkiva. His body was painted white and he wore a blanket
    tied with a girdle (wukokwena), a fox-skin dangling at his loins.
    Nothing was elicited in relation to this event.</p>

  <p>Between 8 and 9 oclock uncostumed groups of Tatcü′kti went to the
    entrances of the kivas and laid themselves prone upon the hatch,
    their heads projecting over its edges. Several of them uttered their
    characteristic growls and pretended to snarl at and worry one another,
    possibly imitating ferocious animals or monsters. One of them carried
    on a dialogue with some one in the kiva.</p>

  <p>At 9 oclock Tümac and two Tuñwúpkatcina (masked but uncostumed) made
    the tour of the pueblos, emitting peculiar hoots. Between 9 and 10
    oclock Owana zrozrokatcina and Wupámokatcina appeared separately, each
    making a solitary tour of the village. They were not masked, but so
    wrapped in blankets that their masks were not visible.</p>

  <p>At 10 oclock the Hano clowns and Natácka group came to Walpi and
    performed the same ceremony as the Walpi group, which has been
    described. There was informal singing in all the kivas.</p>

  <p><i>January 31</i>—During this day the masks of Hililikatcina and
    Soyókmana were painted. After dark a masked man (Katcina not known)
    rushed through the pueblo, and shortly after Tümac and her two sons
    (Tuñwúpkatcina), unmasked, ran through the pueblo hooting. About 9
    oclock delegates from Sitcomovi, with a drum and rattles, made the
    rounds of Walpi and carried on a dialogue with the kiva chief.</p>

  <p>At 10 oclock 18 Tcakwaínakatcinas came to the Móñkiva from Hano.
    They were naked, save a breechcloth, but their bodies and limbs were
    ornamented with white zigzag markings. They wore fillets of a dozen or
    more yucca bands around the head, and necklaces in profusion on their
    necks. They passed in succession into the kivas, dancing a few minutes
    in each, and returned home shortly before midnight.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span></p>

  <p><i>February 1</i>—Several tíhus (dolls) were carved in the kivas, to
    be distributed to the children as in the Nimánkatcina. Tumac and her
    sons went around the pueblo about half past 7 oclock, as on former
    evenings.</p>

  <p>In the Tcivatokiva 14 men and a boy about 10 years of age, with
    Pauwatíwa as chief, whitened their faces, bound a fillet around
    their foreheads, and made curious crescentic marks on their cheeks.
    They afterward danced and sang. Sitcomovi priests, beginning at the
    Móñkiva, made formal visits to each kiva in Walpi. There were 12 of
    these men and they were decorated like those of the Tcivatokiva. They
    sang Síohúmiskatcina songs, but wore no masks. They later visited the
    Sitcomovi kivas. The Tcivatokiva people then put on their kilts, tied
    on their turtle-shell rattles, took their juniper staffs and gourd
    rattles, and, led by Pauwatíwa, went to the Álkiva, and later to all
    the other kivas, where they danced and sang Pawik (duck) Katcina songs.
    Pauwatíwa sprinkled meal on the Katcinas from Sitcomovi before they
    began, and the chiefs of the other kivas did the same to those who
    visited them before they opened their dance.</p>

  <p><i>February 2</i>—This afternoon 8 girls, assisted by the men, washed
    the walls of the Móñkiva with a thin mud made of valley sand. The
    following girls took part in this work: Kaiyónsi, Humisi, Humíta, Lénho
    (a woman), Leúnaisi, Tuvéwaisi, Hokwáti, and Hónka. The girls also made
    mud designs, lightning symbols, and hand-prints on the rafters of the
    room.</p>

  <p>Tuñwúpkatcina<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> (personified by Takála) arrayed himself as follows:
    He donned trousers made of cotton cloth and wrapped himself in a
    blanket, under which he concealed all his paraphernalia. He received
    two bunches of yucca with about twelve or fifteen leaves in each
    bunch, and concealing them under his blanket hastened off to the
    northeastern end of the village. There he arrayed himself, and at 5 p.
    m. he returned, running back and hooting as he came, until he halted at
    the court, where he kept trotting up and down, marking time. He wore
    a mud-head helmet with a black band across the eyes, and parrakeet
    feathers on the top of the head. Turkey-tail feathers were arranged
    radiating horizontally from the crown to the back of the head. He wore
    also a cotton shirt and a kilt girded with a white belt (wukókwena).
    He had yellow clay on his legs and a tortoise-shell rattle below each
    knee. His moccasins were painted black. A whip or bunch of yucca with
    the butts in front was held in each hand.</p>

  <p>The children who were flogged were brought to Tuñwup in the following
    way: The mother, sometimes accompanied by the father, led the child to
    the court, and if it were a boy the godfather took him in charge. He
    gave the lad an ear of corn, his tcótcnunwa, and a handful of prayer
    meal, and led the frightened child close up to Tuñwup. The godfather
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>prompted the boy, who cast his handful of meal on or toward Tuñwup.
    The godfather also cast meal on the same personage and then divested
    the boy of all his clothing and presented the lad with his back toward
    Tuñwup, who all this time had maintained his trotting motion but
    without advancing. Tuñwup then plied one of his yucca wands vigorously,
    giving the boy five or six forcible lashes on the back. After this was
    over the godfather withdrew the screaming boy and tied a nakwákwoci to
    his scalplock. The mother was standing by and hurriedly covered her
    son, frightened with his punishment, and led him home, but the mother
    was careful to see that he carried his tcótcnunwa in his hand.</p>

  <p>If the child were a girl, her godmother led her up to Tuñwup, but her
    little gown was not taken off; only the mantle was removed for the
    flogging. Notwithstanding this, however, the blows were delivered
    with enough force to cause considerable pain, but her crying probably
    resulted as much from fright as from physical suffering. The godmother
    led the little girl back to her home, after having cast meal on Tuñwup,
    and was very careful that the child carried her tcótcnunwa.</p>

  <p>There were five children of age varying from about eight to ten years
    who were thus flagellated. After each boy was flogged the godfather
    cast meal toward Tuñwup and then held out his own bared arms and legs
    successively, which Tuñwup lashed four or five times with all his
    might; but no women were submitted to this flagellation. Several men
    who had some ailment also went up to Tuñwup, and casting meal upon him
    received lashes on their bare arms and legs.</p>

  <p>The man who personified Tuñwup exercised considerable discretion in
    performing his duty. In the case of a little girl who showed more than
    ordinary fear, he simply whirled his yucca whip over her head without
    touching her, and then motioned her away; but on the arms and legs
    of the adults he laid his whip without restraint. When all had been
    flagellated, Pauwatíwa came up from his kiva and gave Tuñwup a handful
    of meal and a nakwákwoci, who then trotted off, going outside the
    pueblo, possibly to preserve the illusion among the children that he
    was a real Katcina who had visited the pueblo from afar.</p>

  <p>For four successive mornings the flagellated child was taken to a point
    on the mesa called Talatiyuka and there deposited a nakwákwoci in a
    shrine and cast meal toward the sun. During this time the child was not
    permitted to eat salt nor flesh, but on the fourth day a little before
    sunset this abstinence ceased, and the child might henceforth look upon
    Katcinas and sacred objects in the kivas without harm.</p>

  <p>The primary significance of the flogging seems to be that until
    children have acquired sufficient intelligence or are eight or ten
    years of age, they are made to believe that the Katcinas, appearing
    at each dance, are superhuman visitors, and they are never permitted
    to see an unmasked Katcina. When they have matured enough or have
    sufficient understanding, they are instructed that the real<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
    Katcinas have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>long since ceased their visits to mankind and are merely
    impersonated by men; but they acquire that knowledge at the expense of
    a sound flogging, such as I have just described.</p>

  <p>At 10 oclock six Tcü′tckütü (clowns), accompanied by Píptuku, who was
    dressed as an old woman and wore an old mask, passed about the pueblo
    from one kiva to another. These six persons entered the Móñkiva, and
    Píptuku, after some urging, followed them. One of the Tcü′tckütü was
    sent out, and the other five in succession took a pinch of ashes in
    the left hand from the fireplace, and poising it as if taking aim at
    something through the hatch struck off the ashes with the right hand.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later four Wuwíyomokatcinas wearing characteristic masks
    appeared at the kiva hatch with turkey feathers radiating vertically
    around the upper part. They carried móñkohus<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and an undressed skin
    pouch. Their leader, Silánktiwa, was without costume, and Cálako,
    Kwátcakwa, and seven other unmasked persons followed. Their faces and
    bodies were whitened, the hair hanging loose, and limbs bare. They wore
    plumes of gaudy feathers on their heads, were arrayed in white kilts,
    and held crooks in their hands. A personage called Eótoto<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> preceded
    them, and Hahaíwüqti, continually talking, followed. The procession was
    closed by a warrior (Kaléktaka),<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> who carried a bundle of arrows in
    one hand and a bow and arrows in the other, and frequently hooted. The
    uncostumed chorus, composed of about twelve persons, accompanied by a
    drummer, followed in a cluster.</p>

  <p>When the leading Wuwíyomo came to the Móñkiva he threw down the
    hatchway a ball of moist meal, which struck the middle of the floor.
    After this announcement he was clamorously invited by those within the
    chamber to enter, which he did, followed by the others. Each Wuwíyomo
    bore a bundle of deer scapulæ, which he clanked as a rattle, and all
    were sprinkled with meal by Íntiwa as they entered the kiva. They
    afterward filed to the western side of the room where the plants were
    growing; they sang for about five minutes, all standing.</p>

  <p>When Eótoto entered the chamber he made on the floor with meal four
    symbols of the rain cloud, one in advance of the other, and each of
    the Cálakos squatted on one of these symbols. The chorus, remaining
    outside, continued their song for a few minutes, while the Wuwíyomos
    were singing. Those who had last entered the kiva then passed out in
    the same order, and as they did so were sprinkled with meal, and each
    of the four Wuwíyomos was handed a nakwákwoci. They then visited the
    other Walpi kivas, where no observations <span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>were made, but the same
    ceremonials were probably repeated. After this they went off to perform
    the same ceremonies in the kivas of other villages on the mesa.</p>

  <p>At 11 oclock a group of 12 men and a boy from Hano, costumed but
    accompanied by an uncostumed fiddler,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> visited all the kivas in
    succession. Their bodies were painted white and they had plumes in
    their hair, but were unmasked. Each wore a fox skin depending from the
    loins, was barefoot, and carried a gourd rattle in the right hand and a
    sprig of spruce in the left hand. Their visits were expected, but they
    personated no especial Katcina and after their departure, the men in
    the Móñkiva rehearsed a song.</p>

  <p><i>February 3</i>—No ceremonial took place throughout the day. The
    walls of the kivas were renovated by the girls with a wash of mud, and
    every kiva on the mesa was replastered in this way during the festival.</p>

  <p><i>February 4</i>—This day the manufacture of tíhus (dolls) went on in
    all the kivas, and there was a continuation of the replastering and
    decoration of the walls of these chambers.</p>

  <p>At 9 oclock a dialogue similar to that above recorded on the 29th of
    January took place between Hahaíwüqti and the kiva chief. The former
    wished to go among the children, but was told that it was very dark and
    the children were asleep. She was finally prevailed on to wait until
    the morrow.</p>

  <p>At 10 p. m. 20 unmasked persons,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> men and women with flowing
    hair, from Sitcomovi visited all the Walpi kivas. Each of the male
    personators carried a narrow green tablet (pavaíyikaci),<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> fringed
    with long red hair and decorated with a symbol of the sun painted in
    colors. Each had a gourd rattle, and a stick about 2 feet long, to the
    end of which was attached half a gourd painted to represent a squash
    blossom, was held in the right hand. The 10 men personating women were
    not costumed. The leader carried a large Oraibi basket tray with a
    broad, brightly colored handle. In this was an effigy of a bird.</p>

  <p>He set this tray on the floor near the fireplace, and after the chief
    of the kiva had sprinkled the visitors with meal a male and a female
    personator advanced from the western end of the kiva to the fireplace.
    The man picked up the basket on the butt end of his stick and presented
    it to the woman, who held it in both hands and danced a few moments,
    while all the others sang. She then laid the tray down and passed to
    the northern side of the chamber, the man retiring to the southern
    side. After the other couples had performed the same ceremony they left
    the kivas.</p>

  <p>Immediately after their departure 28 personators from Hano entered.
    These consisted of male and female deities, the latter personated by
    men. The former passed to the southern, the latter to the northern
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>side of the kiva. Each of the male personages wore a yucca fillet on
    his head and his legs were decorated with clay streaks; he wore white
    kilts and girdles, with dependent fox-skins. They also had tortoise
    rattles on the legs and carried a gourd rattle in the right hand. Their
    costume was as follows: They were without masks; the hair was loose and
    an imitation of a squash blossom was tied therein. The face was not
    colored, but on the right shoulder curving to the breast was daubed
    a mass of blue and green pigment. On the left shoulder and over the
    breast they were painted with yellow, and bright red streaks were drawn
    from the neck down the center of the breast and middle of the back.
    The upper part of the right arm was colored yellow, the left forearm
    green, the upper part of the left arm green. These colors were reversed
    on the right arm. The right leg also was yellow and the left leg was
    green with two contrasting bands below the knee. The hands, waist, and
    upper portion of the thighs were whitened. They likewise wore white
    kilts tied with girdles (wukokwéna and nanelkwéna). A gray fox-skin
    depended from the loins. Each had a tortoise shell rattle on the right
    leg and on the left leg generally a garter to which small sleigh-bells
    were attached. Their moccasins were blue or green. In his right hand
    each carried a blue or green painted rattle, and in the left a sprig
    or small branch of spruce. Those personating females neither wore
    fox-skins nor held anything in the left hand. The female personators
    carried in the left hand a bundle of straw held well up before the
    face. After they had been sprinkled with meal they began to sing, and
    the couple in the center on the west side joined hands, holding them
    above the head—the female with the palm turned up, the male with the
    palm down and fingers imbricated. They advanced close to the fireplace
    and then returned to their respective places. The personators executed
    this figure four times in sequence and then went out.</p>

  <p>Immediately after this presentation the delegation from the Móñkiva,
    led by a masked person, entered. The bodily decorations of these were
    not uniform; one had a figure of a gourd drawn on his breast, another
    zigzag lines, and still another parallel bars. The males carried a
    gourd rattle in the right hand; they wore no fillets on the head but
    allowed the hair to hang loosely. The female personators held a bunch
    of straw<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and a sprig of spruce in the left hand, carrying it high
    up before the face. They sang the same song and executed the same
    figure as that already mentioned in the account of the presentation by
    the men from the village of Hano. The groups finished their visits at
    about midday.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

  <p><i>February 5</i>—At earliest dawn (5 a. m.) either the chief or one
    of his elders roused all the sleepers in the kiva, and each spread his
    blanket beside his basin of growing plants. He then carefully plucked
    the plants, one by one, so as not to bruise either stalk or roots.
    He laid them on the blanket in an orderly pile, the leaves together.
    The sand which remained in the basin was carried to some place where
    children would not see it, and the vessels were dried before the kiva
    fire and hidden away in the houses out of sight of the prying eyes of
    the young ones.</p>

  <p>Nearly all the plants were tied with a yucca shred and a sprig of
    spruce (symbol of a Katcina), in neat bundles, leaving loose bights of
    the yucca by which to hold them. Each priest also tied up the dolls
    which he had made. All traces of the soil in which the corn had been
    forced to sprout had disappeared long before dawn.</p>

  <p>The presents (dolls) which were made in the Tcivatoki were then
    distributed by a man personifying Pawíkkatcina, under the instruction
    of those who had fashioned them. The distributing Katcinas of the
    Nacabki were two Nüváktcinas,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and the same did this duty with
    the dolls in the Móñkiva. For the Álkiva two Tcoshühüwûh performed
    this duty. These Katcinas and two persons called Kawaíka (Keres)
    from Sitcomovi bustled about the pueblo on their errands and the
    distribution was finished about sunrise. The men did not speak when
    they approached a house with their gifts, but hooted after the
    customary manner of Katcinas.</p>

  <p>Almost half an hour before sunrise the Soyókmana passed around the
    kivas, holding a dialogue at the hatchways with the chiefs inside.
    She wore a black conical mask with red mouth and white teeth, and was
    costumed as an old woman. In the right hand she bore a crook 7 feet
    long, at the end of which were tied many shells. In the left hand
    she carried a knife smeared with rabbit blood. Hü′hüwûh also held
    a dialogue with the kiva chiefs and made gifts of watermelons and
    squashes to various persons.</p>

  <p>At 11.30 a. m. Soyókmana, Hahaíwüqti, and the Natáckas (plate
    <a href="#CVI"><span class="allsmcap"><abbr title="106">CVI</abbr></span></a>) made a visit to all the houses. They were followed by two
    Hehéakatcinas<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> with bags and pouches of food recently received, and
    after them followed three black and two white Natáckas. These five went
    together and were constantly in motion, moving or beating time with
    their feet.</p>

  <p>The strange company went to each house demanding food, and when it was
    refused or poor quality offered the Natáckas uttered a hoot like an
    owl, and at the same time Soyókmana whistled. They refused to leave a
    house until proper food had been given them, and if a child who had not
    been ceremonially flogged appeared with the mother its eyes were shaded
    by the mother’s hand while she presented food to the Natáckas.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

  <p>Between 12 and 1 oclock Íntiwa, assisted by Hoñyi and Letaiyo,
    finished making twelve sets of cákwa (blue) páhos, most of which were
    composed of two sticks of uniform diameter, and only one set showed
    the flat face characteristic of the female. They likewise made twelve
    nakwákwoci hotomni, consisting of a twig about 2 feet long from which
    four nakwákwocis depended at intervals, and twelve simple feathered
    strings. When these were finished Íntiwa placed them in a tray of meal
    beside the sípapû and brought from the paraphernalia closet of the kiva
    six ears of corn of different colors, his típoni, two nákwipis and as
    many aspergills, two or more rattles, and other bundles containing the
    remaining paraphernalia of the cloud-charm altar.</p>

  <p>At 1.30 p. m. he placed a small hillock of sand back of the sípapû and
    deposited his típoni upright upon it; he then made the cloud-charm
    altar,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> arranging the corn at the ends of six radial lines of meal
    in a sinistral circuit, placing two crystals upon each ear of corn
    except that corresponding to the nadir. The aspergills (makwámpis) also
    were laid down beside each ear of corn except that which was symbolic
    of the nadir. The sequence of ceremonials which then took place about
    this altar was as follows:</p>

  <ol class="mt0">
    <li>Ceremonial smoke.</li>
    <li>Prayers.</li>
    <li>Liquid poured into the crenelated vessel or nákwipi.</li>
    <li>Songs.<br>
      <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Synopsis of ceremonial events during the songs:</span>
      <ol class="paren">
        <li>Meal shaken from the six aspergills into the liquid.</li>
        <li>Whistling into the liquid through a turkey bone, and
          asperging to the cardinal points with the same, six times in all.</li>
        <li>Meal cast into liquid, on tray of páhos and over the
          típoni in ceremonial circuit.</li>
        <li>Pollen cast on the same objects in sequence.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Prayers.</li>
    <li>Ceremonial smoke into the liquid with two pipes.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>At the close of this observance Hahaíwüqti and the Natáckas came to
    the kiva hatch and a comic dialogue ensued. She demanded meat and
    other food, and the elders went up the ladder and refused to grant
    her wishes. Natácka hooted and Soyókmana whistled back, and then the
    Hehéakatcinas threw down the end of their lariat, and those in the kiva
    below hung a piece of sheepskin and horns of goats to it.</p>

  <p>Íntiwa then called two youths, and without anointing them<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> gave them
    instructions where to deposit the offerings which had been consecrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
    on the cloud-charm altar.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> One youth was told to deposit his at
    shrines in a circuit, beginning with Tawapa (Sun spring), and the other
    at Kokyanba (Spider spring) and Tuveskyabi. Two sets of offerings were
    left, and these with Katcinas were placed on the southwest point of the
    mesa. This closed the ceremony, for Íntiwa then replaced the plug of
    the sípapû and tied up his típoni and other paraphernalia.</p>

  <p>The Natácka group went to the Wikwaliobikiva, and there Sóyoko gave
    each of them and the Hehéakatcina a handful of meal and a nakwákwoci.
    Taláhoya blew puffs of smoke over them. They then marched around
    the houses to the Nacabki, along the plaza to Tcivatoki, and then
    to Álkiva, where they begged for meat and held comic dialogues with
    different chiefs. At the last-mentioned place there came from the kiva
    six men arrayed and costumed as the Mamzraúti tcatumakaa, who, singing
    as they went, marched to the dance court and halted close to the edge
    of the cliff, facing the houses. The Natácka group accompanied them,
    and two men personifying Hehéakatcinas assumed erotic paroxysms and
    lay down on their backs on the ground close to the disguised Mamzraúti
    personages, endeavoring to lift up their kilts and performing obscene
    actions. Then they rolled on the ground in assumed fits. The Natáckas,
    as usual, maintained their prancing step around them, and occasionally
    Soyókmana thumped them with the butt end of her crook. After about five
    minutes of this exhibition the Hehéa seized the Mamzraúti personators
    and tumbled them into an indiscriminate heap, fell on top of them, and
    did other acts which need not be mentioned. The Natácka then retired
    for food, and, unmasking in the kiva, did not again appear.</p>

  <p><i>February 6</i>—Food was carried to all the kivas yesterday morning,
    but there was neither dancing nor ceremonials.</p>

  <p><i>February 7</i>—No ceremony took place on this day, but the kiva
    chief and the Hehéakatcinas played a curious game of ball called
    sunwuwinpa, in which the ball is attached to a looped string. The
    player lay on his back and, passing the loop over the great toe,
    projected the ball back over his head. Two groups of these players were
    noted.</p>

  <p>The following Katcinas were personated in the Powámû of 1893:<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Hahaíwüqti, Ancient Woman, Mother of Monsters.</li>

  <h4 id="PALULUKONTI">PÁLÜLÜKOÑTI</h4>

  <p>The screen drama of the Pálülükoñti ceremonial as performed in 1893 has
    already been described.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

  <p>The following personifications of Katcinas appeared in the Pálülükoñti
    in 1893:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Coyóhim, All.</li>
    <li>Pawík, Duck.</li>
    <li>Tacáb, Navaho.</li>
    <li>Hokyaña.</li>
    <li>Húhian, Barter.</li>
    <li>Cálako, Cálako.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Its presentation in other years differs very materially from the
    description given.</p>

  <p>In the celebration of 1891 a wooden figure representing Cálako was
    introduced with two carved marionettes, which were manipulated as if
    grinding corn, and serpent effigies were thrust through the sun opening
    of the screen. These were likewise used in the presentation in 1894.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

  <p>The celebration of Pálülükoñti in 1894 was controlled by the Badger
    people, and the exhibition of the screen drama occurred March 16.
    A number of slabs with symbolic figures of Táwa (the sun), and
    Cótükinuñwa (the heart of all the sky), and two small effigies of
    Pálülükoñûh (plumed snake) were introduced. The two mechanical
    figurines, which were so manipulated as to appear to be in the act of
    grinding corn on metates, represented Cálakomanas, and were made by
    Tótci of the Badger people.</p>

  <p>This variation from year to year, it will be observed, preserves
    without change the various deities introduced and recalls what I
    have already written about the variations in altars of the Nimán in
    different villages. In stage effects latitude is permissible, but there
    is no change in the deities represented. Something similar occurs in
    the Mamzraúti, where, in 1891, tablets with Palahíkomana symbols were
    used, while in 1893 women represented that personage.</p>

  <p>So far as I know the essential personages<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> to be represented by
    symbolism or by men in disguise, are:</p>

  <ul class="mt0">
    <li>Táwa, Sun.</li>
    <li>Mü′iyawû, Moon.</li>
    <li>Cótokinuñwa, Heart of the Sky.</li>
    <li>Hahaíwüqti, Ancient Mother.</li>
    <li>Pálülükoñti, Plumed Snake.</li>
    <li>Cálako taka or mana, Corn Man or Maid.</li>
    <li>Various Katcinas, mentioned above, but these may vary year by year.</li>
    <li>Másauwûh, Fire God.</li>
    <li>Various Tcukúwympkiyas, Clowns.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="NIMANKATCINA">NIMÁNKATCINA</h4>

  <p>An outline of the ceremonials attending the departure of the
    Katcinas from three of the Tusayan villages has already been given
    elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> From new observations it is found that much remains to
    complete this account, but the main events have already been described.
    While the dance resembles the abbreviated Katcinas, from which it
    should not be widely separated, the altar and kiva ceremonials place
    it in the group of elaborate Katcinas or those with complicated secret
    usages. It is only in those villages in which are preserved the wími
    of the Kachina móñwi that this celebration can occur, although, as
    we shall later see, abbreviated Katcinas are not so limited. It will
    probably be found that any abbreviated Katcina may be used for the
    public dance of the Nimán, but no abbreviated Katcina can have the
    secret ceremonials of the Nimán without becoming the same. When the
    Katcina chief, Íntiwa, sets up his altar it is but natural that any
    set of Katcinas may give the public dance, which, while a necessary
    accompaniment, is far from being prescribed as to kind.</p>

  <h3 id="ABBREVIATED_KATCINAS">ABBREVIATED KATCINAS</h3>

  <h4 id="CHARACTERISTICS">CHARACTERISTICS</h4>

  <p>This group includes a large number of simple ceremonials in which
    a masked dance in public is the most significant part. The general
    character of these observances may be seen by a consultation of my
    article, “A few summer ceremonials at the Tusayan pueblos.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
    The distinctive name is determined by the characters personified
    as indicated by the symbolic markings of the masks or by other
    paraphernalia. No elaborate kiva ceremonials are performed.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

  <p>All the abbreviated presentations have certain common features which
    run through them. These characteristics may be learned from my
    description in the article on “The summer ceremonials,”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> but in
    order to make them more prominent I have mentioned them in an appended
    footnote.<a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

  <p>The special Katcina celebrated is designated by the symbolism depicted
    on the mask, which is repainted and redecorated according to the
    Katcina which it is intended to represent. For the special <span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>name and
    the accompanying symbolism a study of the dolls will give as good an
    idea as can yet be obtained from published articles.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

  <p>The participants in the abbreviated Katcinas may be divided into
    two groups: (1) The Katcinas, male and female, with related masked
    personages, and the priests who pray to them and sprinkle meal upon
    them, and (2) the accompanying clowns and masked or other persons
    who participate in their antics and presentation. The details of
    the proceedings of the second or possibly subordinate group vary in
    different dances more than those of the first.</p>

  <p>The participants of the first group are:</p>

  <p>1. Masked personages (always men) called Katcinas.</p>

  <p>2. Masked men, personifying women, called Katcinamanas.</p>

  <p>3. One or more masked persons, who vary in symbolic characters in
    different Katcinas. These are often absent.</p>

  <p>4. Priests (unmasked), directors of the dance, who sprinkle the
    Katcinas with sacred meal. These priests are vehicles of prayers to the
    Katcinas and masked participants, and are generally few in number.</p>

  <p>The presentation is accompanied with a feast<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> (generally at noon)
    limited to Katcinas and Katcinamanas. The Katcinas dance in line,
    sing, distribute gifts, but never utter any continuous sentence or
    prayer. The Katcinamanas dance in line facing the Katcinas, or kneel
    in front of the same, accompanying their songs with a rasping noise
    made by rubbing a scapula over a notched stick. Ordinarily their
    mask is identical in all Katcinas of the abbreviated form, and they
    generally have their hair in two whorls on the sides of the head,
    and wear white blankets and other feminine apparel. The second group
    of personifications are the Tcukúwympkiyas (Tatcü′kti, knob-head
    priests; Tcü′ckütû, gluttons; or Paiakaíamû, horned clowns). Their
    representation consists of a series of antics and dramatizations, story
    telling, gluttony, obscene gestures or bawdy remarks, and flogging and
    other indignities heaped upon each other or upon accompanying masked
    persons. These representations and the personifications who carry on
    their portion of the observance vary in different reproductions of the
    same drama.</p>

  <p>The Tcukúwympkyia do not dance or sing with the Katcinas, but sprinkle
    them with meal and pray to them. While an essential feature in certain
    abbreviated Katcinas, they are not always present, and their exhibition
    has many secular or temporal characteristics or innovations more
    or less dependent on the invention of the participants. The masked
    persons who assist them are representatives of semimythologic beings,
    called Píptuka, Ü′tci (Apache), Tacáb (Navaho), Kése, and others. A
    description of the various modifications of their performances would
    mean special account of each presentation <span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>and would vary in details
    for each exhibition, but except in a very general way these variations
    are quite unimportant in the study of the characteristics of the
    abbreviated Katcinas. The following are some of the episodes introduced:</p>

  <p>1. Inordinate eating and begging, urine drinking, gluttony, and
    obscenity.</p>

  <p>2. Flogging of one another, stripping off breechcloths, drenching with
    foul water, ribald remarks to spectators, and comical episodes with
    donkeys and dogs.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 40</span>—The Áñakatcina.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>3. Story telling for pieces of corn under severe flogging by masked
    persons, races, smearing one another with blood, urinating upon one
    another, tormenting with cactus branches, etc.</p>

  <p>The Katcina dance ordinarily lasts from daybreak to sunset, with
    intermissions, during which the participants unmask under an
    overhanging cliff on the southern side of the mesa. Here likewise they
    have their feast at midday. The dances in the forenoon are slimly
    attended by spectators, but in the afternoon all the terraces and roofs
    of the houses surrounding the plaza<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> in which the pillar mound is
    situated are occupied by natives and visitors. The line of Katcinas
    is led by an uncostumed chief, who sprinkles meal on the ground as he
    enters and leaves the dance court, and who from time to time shouts to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>the dancers (figure <a href="#FIG40">40</a>). The leader of the Katcinas stands midway
    in the line, and by a rapid movement of his rattle as a signal changes
    the song and directs the termination. To him<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> as a representative
    the prayers are addressed. The dance is a rhythmic stamping movement of
    one foot on the ground, and all keep in line, elbowing their neighbors,
    turning now to one side, then to another, as directed. The female
    Katcinas face the male and stand about midway in the line. They use the
    serrated stick and scapula as an accompaniment to the song.</p>

  <p>It is common for both male and female Katcinas to bring gifts to the
    plaza for spectators, especially children, as they return to the
    dance.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> These gifts are ordinarily corn, bread, or tortillas. It is
    customary for priests to sprinkle the Katcinas with sacred meal, and
    the Tcukúwympkiyas, or clowns, also perform this function. The típoni
    or Katcina badge of office is not carried in every celebration, nor
    does the Katcina chief, Íntiwa, always lead the line.</p>

    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41</span>—Maskette of Áñakatcinamana.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The one garment worn by the male Katcinas is the ceremonial kilt. This
    is not confined to them, but is likewise worn in other ceremonials, as
    in the Snake-Antelope observance and in minor celebrations. Every male
    Katcina, whatever his helmet, has one of these about his loins. It is
    made of coarse cotton, on the ends of which are embroidered symbolic
    figures of rain-clouds, falling rain, and lightning. Ordinarily half
    of the width is painted green, and the lower edge is black, with nine
    square blocks of the same color at regular intervals. This kilt is
    represented on many dolls of the Katcinas figured in my article on that
    subject.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

  <p>The Katcinas, irrespective of the special personage depicted, wear a
    broad cotton sash with knotted strings at the proximal end. In this
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>belt spruce branches are held. A fox-skin depends from the belt, and
    turtle-shell rattles on the leg are invariably part of a Katcina’s
    costume. Moccasins and heel bands are prescribed and bodily decoration
    with pigments is common, but none of the above are characteristic of
    special kinds of Katcinas. The mask is in general the one distinctive
    characteristic of a definite personification.</p>

  <h4 id="SIOCALAKO">SÍOCÁLAKO</h4>

  <p>The Shálako is one of the most important observances at Zuñi, and is
    partially described by Cushing in an article on his life in Zuñi.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
    An exhaustive account, however, has never been published. The Hopi
    occasionally celebrate a Cálako, which from its name and other reasons
    is undoubtedly an incorporated modification of this ceremonial, as
    the Tusayan legends distinctly state.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The following pages give an
    outline of the Hopi presentation as a contribution to the comparative
    study of Pueblo ritual. A complete account of the Shálako at Zuñi is a
    great desideratum before it is possible to undertake close comparisons.</p>

  <p>The presentation of Cálako is not an annual event at the East mesa of
    Tusayan, but occurs after long intervals of time. The paraphernalia are
    kept in a house in Sitcomovi and belong to the Badger clan. The house
    in which they are deposited is the property of Koĭkáamü, the daughter
    of Masiúmtiwa’s eldest sister, now deceased, and the wími likewise
    belong to her by descent.</p>

  <p>The chiefs of all the gentes in Walpi and Sitcomovi, the chief of the
    Katcinas, and one or two others from Hano assembled in this house on
    the 16th of July, 1893, and made a large number (over two hundred) of
    páhos for use in the ceremonials to be described.</p>

  <p>Early on the morning of the next day the masks and effigies of
    Siocálako were renovated and carried to the spring called Kwañwába
    (sweet water), which is situated on the Zuñi trail southward from
    the mesa. In a modern house owned by a Sitcomovi family<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> at this
    spring the masks were repainted and the hoops which were used to make a
    framework for the bodies were set around with eagle feathers.</p>

  <p>The effigies which were used in personifications were made up of masks
    or helmets of the ordinary size for the heads and a crinoline-like<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
    framework of willow hoops for the bodies. These masks were made from
    narrow shreds of leaves of the agave plaited together diagonally, and
    this plaited frame was covered with a painted buckskin upon which the
    symbolism of the Síocálako was delineated. The projecting beak of the
    face had a movable under jaw, which was hinged and manipulated with
    a string. The helmet was attached to a staff forming a backbone, 3½
    feet long, by which it was carried. The series of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>crinoline hoops or
    supports of the blankets which formed the body were about fifteen in
    number, the upper being about the size of the helmet, the lower 4½ feet
    in diameter. A tü′ihi or large white embroidered mantle was draped
    about the upper hoops or the shoulders, and a gray fox-skin was hung
    around the neck, which was likewise profusely decorated with shell
    necklaces.</p>

  <p>The man who acted the part of bearer walked inside the crinoline,
    freely supporting the effigy by the staff or backbone, holding it at
    such a height as to permit the lowest hoop with its attached feathers
    to reach to his knees. Each effigy bearer was bareheaded, and although
    hidden from view, was decorated with the white kilt of a typical
    Katcina.</p>

  <p>An uncostumed chief led the four giants in single file toward the mesa,
    followed by a large number of men dressed as mud-heads or Tatcü′kti,
    who were called “Koyímse,” a term adapted from their Zuñi name.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
    All who had sufficient knowledge of the idiom spoke Zuñi, and the
    procession reached the Sun spring (Tawápa) at about sunset. It was
    there met by two priests, Taláhoya and a nephew of Masiúmtiwa, who
    were to act as conductors. All were welcomed and homoya (prayers)
    were recited and much sacred meal was sprinkled. Headed by the two
    conductors the procession climbed the trail to the top of the mesa,
    and from thence marched into the main court of Sitcomovi by the
    northeastern entrance, near which the men bearing the four giant
    effigies, together with the mud-heads, halted. The latter were closely
    huddled together in four groups, drumming with deafening noise on as
    many drums.</p>

  <p>The Katcina chief, Íntiwa, and a man personifying Eótoto<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> then
    drew four circles with intersecting lines of meal on the ground at
    the north side of the court in the positions indicated. This was
    followed by a command of Hahaíwüqti, who signaled with an ear of corn
    for the first (kwiníwi, north) Cálako effigy to advance. He did so
    with a short, rapid step, and halted over the first circle of meal.
    The “bearer” bobbed the effigy up and down so that the feathers which
    had been fastened to the lower hoop of the crinoline touched the
    ground. The bearer then stooped and rested the end of his staff on the
    ground, holding it upright. The other three giant impersonators were
    then brought up, one at a time, by Hahaíwüqti. As each settled to its
    position the bearer cried “Ho!” six times in a shrill falsetto, and
    rapidly snapped the beak of the effigy he bore by means of a string.
    The Cálakos were then sprinkled with meal by the chiefs and others,
    after which the effigies were moved one by one to circles of meal on
    the southern side of the plaza. Six times this removal was repeated,
    each time attended by ceremonials similar to those mentioned above.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span></p>

  <p>At the conclusion of this observance in the plaza the four giants were
    conducted by the chiefs of the Lizard, Ása, Badger, and Water gentes
    to the houses of the elder sisters of the respective clans. The Cálako
    effigies were suspended by the mask from the rafters of each room, and
    as the length of each was 7 feet 6 inches the tips of the radiating
    feathers on the head and those on the last hoop of the framework of the
    body just touched the roof and floor of the chamber. The same ceremony
    look place in each house and there were prayers by the elders, dancing
    by the effigy bearers, and singing and drumming by the “Koyímse.” At
    sunrise—for the exhibitions in the houses lasted all night—a final
    presentation in the court similar to that which opened the ceremonies
    took place, after which the Cálakos and mud-heads went to the cliff and
    unmasked at the Kachinaki. There they performed purification ceremonies
    (navótciwa) and dismantled the effigies. They donned their ordinary
    habiliments and smuggled the paraphernalia back into the chamber in
    Sitcomovi, where it is ordinarily kept.</p>

  <p>On the 8th and 9th of the month, following the demise of the Cálakos, a
    most elaborate Wáwac or Racing Katcina was performed.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

  <h4 id="PAWIKKATCINA">PAWÍKKATCINA</h4>

  <p>The Pawíkkatcina, which I observed at Sitcomovi in 1892, had certain
    differences from any abbreviated Katcina dance which I have yet
    described, and illustrated the ceremonial reception of these personages
    after they had visited another pueblo. A priest of Sitcomovi suggested
    that his fellow villagers should send a delegation of young men to
    Cipaulovi to return a dance with which they had previously been honored
    by the latter pueblo. Accordingly the masks were painted and the
    preliminary ceremonials took place in one of the Sitcomovi kivas, those
    who were to participate in the ceremonial beginning their work on the
    25th of June. The visitors danced all day of the 27th at Cipaulovi,
    rested on the 28th, and continued their dance on the 29th at Sitcomovi.
    The ceremonials on their return at the trail approaching Sitcomovi took
    place on June 28th, an hour before sunset.</p>

    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43</span>—Mask of Pawíkkatcina (front view).</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>This dance differed very little from that of other Katcinas, to which
    attention has hitherto been directed.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> There were twenty-three
    Katcinas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span> and five<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Katcinamanas, and the masks of both are
    illustrated in figures <a href="#FIG43">43</a>, <a href="#FIG44">44</a>, and <a href="#FIG45">45</a>, while one of the staffs which
    they bore is represented in figure <a href="#FIG46">46</a>. They sang five songs called
    Ómowûh (cloud), Yoivíkka (swift), Pakwa (frog), Pawykia (duck), and
    Patzro (quail). An interesting feature which I had never before seen in
    Tusayan abbreviated Katcinas was the unmasked dance in the kiva.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

  <p>The secret ceremonials in the kiva were as follows: The three priests,
    who had previously bathed their heads in their own houses, made the
    páhos and nakwákwocis. Two of these men made four prayer sticks similar
    to those described in the Walpi ceremonial, and one made a long single
    páho. These were deposited in a flat basket tray and smoked upon by
    those present. Before beginning the manufacture of the páhos the makers
    prepared themselves by a ceremonial smoke.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> At the same time that
    the páhos were made twenty-three nakwákwocis for the Katcinas and five
    for the Katcinamanas were likewise manufactured.</p>

  <p>At midday food was passed down into the kiva, but before partaking of
    it one of the priests took a pinch of each kind of food (dunópna) and
    went with it to a cleft in the mesa on the north side of Sitcomovi. He
    there deposited it with a páho, a pinch of each kind of pigment used in
    painting the paraphernalia, a little tobacco,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> but no sacred meal.
    This was an offering, it was said, to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado
    sípapû. He then went to the southern side of the mesa and placed in a
    similar cleft a nakwákwoci, said to be an offering to Másauwûh.</p>

  <p>Ceremonials attending visits of people from adjacent or remote
    pueblos are simple but interesting. The following reception ceremony
    of visitors from a distant pueblo not of their own people was noted:
    In the progress of the summer dances of Walpi in 1892 I observed the
    ceremonial reception of several Zuñis who came over to assist in the
    Húmiskatcina. They were formally “received” in the Wikwaliobi kiva by
    Íntiwa,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Kópeli, Hóñyi, Pauatíwa, and Lésma. Íntiwa gave their
    headman a twig of spruce, to which Lésma tied four nakwákwocis.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
    Íntiwa sprinkled it with sacred meal and laid <span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>it in front of the
    Zuñis, and finally all smoked together. This was said to be a formal
    act of reception.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

  <p>The reception ceremony of the Pawíkkatcinas when they returned from
    Cipaulovi was as follows: At 4 p. m. Pauatíwa’s father, a very old man,
    sat on the edge of the mesa looking west and north toward Cipaulovi. He
    called my attention to a line of men coming along the trail. When the
    line halted on the last rise before the trail ascends to the top of the
    mesa we went down to welcome them.</p>

  <figure class="figleft illowp21" style="margin-right: 0.5em;" id="FIG47">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i072.jpg" alt="drawing">
    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47</span>—Helmets, ear of corn, and spruce bough
      arranged for reception ceremony.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Each Katcina placed his helmet in one of two parallel lines arranged
    along the trail, and in front of the two lines he laid the spruce bough
    which he carried. In front of this pile of spruce boughs an ear of corn
    was placed in the trail not far from the helmets. All the Katcinas then
    marched around the line in a sinistral circuit, sprinkling sacred meal
    upon the masks, corn, and spruce boughs and throwing a pinch along the
    trail in advance of the ear of corn. The circuit around the line of
    helmets was sinistral, as in all Hopi ceremonials.</p>

  <p>Nine old men then formed a circle at the left of the corn and smoked,
    sitting in a squatting posture.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> No one was allowed to go up the
    trail before this ceremony was completed, and one who attempted to
    do so was warned back. A short address of welcome was spoken by the
    priests to the leader of the Katcinas, and at sunset they put on their
    masks and marched to the plaza of Sitcomovi. They first danced on the
    southern, then on the eastern, and lastly on the western sides of the
    plaza, omitting the northern side. The priests sprinkled the Katcinas
    with sacred meal, observing the sinistral ceremonial circuit as they
    passed around the line. A small spruce tree, upon which nakwákwocis
    were tied, had been placed near the middle of the plaza.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span></p>

  <p>The Katcinas and Katcinamanas then adjourned to the kiva, where they
    unmasked, placing their helmets in a row and the spruce boughs in the
    middle of the kiva.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The two priests seated themselves on the
    uprise, one on each side of the ladder.</p>

  <p>On the following day the dance was continued from sunrise to sunset. In
    the afternoon there appeared the Tcúkuwympkiya, Muñ′we (Owl Katcina),
    two Tcósbüci, Pü′ükoñhoya (the Little War God), and a Navaho Katcina.</p>

  <h4 id="ANAKATCINA">ÁÑAKATCINA</h4>

  <p>The celebration of the Áñakatcina at Hano, in the Nimán of 1892, gave
    me the following additional data to that already mentioned in the
    description<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> of the Áña of 1891. These are due in part to the
    variations in ceremonial customs, and are not regarded as essentials.</p>

  <p>The Hopi Áñakatcina was invited to Hano by Kálakwai, and its public
    presentation was identical with that of 1891 and that of the Zuñi
    Kókokci. The antics of the gluttons were very much more complicated.
    This I ascribe to two causes—the rarity with which Katcinas are
    celebrated in Hano, and the great need of rain at the time.</p>

  <p>One interesting but highly disgusting part of the show of these priests
    was the slaughter of a huge dog and the use of his entrails and blood
    in distinguishing one of their number as Másauwûh,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> the Death god.
    The details of this may be had by consultation with the author.</p>

  <p>About 4 oclock on the morning of the public dance of the Áña the
    participants danced in the Hano plaza, destitute of all clothing or
    helmets and accompanied by the clowns, also without masks. This feature
    I had not previously observed. After this early dance páhos were
    deposited at the shrine situated in the middle of the dance plaza.</p>

  <p>As no account of the ceremonial deposit of offerings to the winds has
    ever been published, the following observations are given to fill this
    gap in our knowledge. Probably the object of the wind offerings is
    propitiatory, for high wind, it is believed, blows away the rain, to
    produce which is the main object of the observance. Kwálakwa took for
    this purpose in a blanket the following objects: Nakwákwocis, native
    tobacco, paper bread, píkami (pudding mush), sugar, and peaches. He
    deposited a packet containing a pinch of each of these in six <span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>shrines
    situated at cardinal points, beginning at the east.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> The Hopi
    begin their ceremonial circuit ordinarily at the north, but the Tewa,
    it would seem, place their offerings in the following order: East,
    northwest, southwest by south, southwest, southeast by east, southeast.</p>

  <p>In the interval between two of the dances, while the Katcinas were
    unmasked, and had halted under an overhanging rock on the trail a few
    feet below Hano, I observed a test of endurance which I had never
    before seen. Kópeli, the Snake chief, took a bundle of yucca branches,
    and different volunteers from the Katcinas, stepping up to him, first
    held out one arm, then the other; Kópeli struck the outstretched limb
    with more or less force, and at the conclusion presented his own arm
    and naked body for this trying ordeal. The Áñakatcina is illustrated in
    figure <a href="#FIG40">40</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="nobreak" id="COMPARATIVE_STUDY">COMPARATIVE STUDY OF KATCINA DANCES IN CIBOLA AND TUSAYAN</h2>

  <p>The published material which can be used as a basis of comparison in
    the study of Katcinas in other villages is meager and insufficient.
    Even of the nearest pueblo, Zuñi, which has been more studied than many
    of the others, and in which Katcina observances closely akin to those
    of Tusayan are performed, the published accounts are very limited. In
    a general way it seems to me that the Tusayan ceremonials are more
    showy and elaborate than those at Zuñi. There is, however, one marked
    exception;<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> the powerful war society, called the Priesthood of the
    Bow, has more elaborate ceremonials in Zuñi than in Walpi, where this
    organization is weak. It is not possible from my limited knowledge of
    Zuñi ceremonials to declare that it is less complicated than that of
    Tusayan, but I believe that the powerful organization mentioned has had
    much to do with many of the differences between the two.</p>

  <p>One source of information in regard to the differences and likenesses
    between the Zuñi and Hopi ceremonials is the testimony of the chiefs
    themselves. This does not hold in regard to modified ceremonials
    primarily the same or derived from a common source, and is only
    hearsay, not science.</p>

  <p>All the Hopi priests say that the Siotü (Zuñis) have no knowledge of
    the Tcütcübwimi (Snake-Antelope mysteries). The same chiefs likewise
    claim that the Zuñis have no Mamzraúti, Lálakoñti,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Wüwütcímti, and
    no societies corresponding to the Tátaukyamû, Áaltû, or Kwákwantû.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span></p>

  <p>Although they may not reproduce some of these ceremonials in the form
    celebrated by the Hopi, it is not clear to me that some of those which
    they observe may not be differentiations of the same ceremony, as I
    have shown in my accounts of the women’s dances.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> There is a marked
    similarity in many of the myths, which would seem to imply resemblances
    in ritualistic dramatizations of the same.</p>

  <p>It is possible to verify historical data and legendary history by a
    study of the same ceremony. For instance, the five oldest Tusayan
    pueblos of which we have accounts in the earliest records are Awatobi,
    Walpi, Micoñinovi, Cuñopavi, and Oraibi.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Awatobi was destroyed in
    1700, so that but four original communities of the time of Vargas still
    remain. It is in these four and at Cipaulovi that the Snake ceremony is
    still celebrated, and Sitcomovi and Hano are ascribed by Hopi legends
    to a much later time than the first appearance of the Spaniards; their
    names do not appear in the early descriptions of the province.</p>

  <p>It is a mistaken idea, and one which has led to many misconceptions,
    to suppose that what is true of one group of pueblos is true of all.
    While in a general way the mythology and ritual of all may be said to
    have general resemblances, there is far from an identity between the
    ceremonials, for instance, of the Hopi and the Zuñi, or those of the
    Rio Grande pueblos and Tusayan. It is not a question of knowing all by
    an intimate knowledge of one; but each branch, even individual pueblos,
    must be investigated separately before by comparative knowledge we
    can obtain an adequate conception of the character of the pueblo
    type of mythology and ritual. Moreover, there is evidence that this
    difference existed in ancient times, and while the differentiation of
    the manners and customs of different pueblos may have been less rapid
    in the past than today they were far from being identical. It does
    not follow, except in certain limits, that the most primitive pueblos
    today show in their survivals a better picture of the character of life
    in another pueblo than the existing state of things in the latter. To
    reconstruct the probable character of the ancient culture we must trace
    similarities by comparative studies.</p>

  <p>In a comparative study of the ceremonials of different pueblos, it is
    important to decide which are most primitive or nearest the aboriginal
    condition and which are least affected by foreign influences. The
    purer the present aboriginal culture, the greater worth will it have
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>in our approximation to a true conception of the primitive pueblo
    culture. Many of the Pueblos practice a religious system which may
    be rightly called aboriginal, but in some it has been modified by
    outside influences. I think no one, for instance, would say that the
    present Zuñi custom of burial in a churchyard was not due in part to
    the influence of Catholic priests, for Spanish narratives of three and
    a half centuries ago are quite explicit in their statement that the
    Zuñi burned their dead. If one custom has been changed, how are we
    to distinguish the modified from the primitive? It can be shown that
    strong influences have been used for the direct purpose of destroying
    the Katcina worship. Take, for instance, Zuñi, the least changed
    of all the pueblos except those of Tusayan. It is pagan today, and
    probably never was profoundly modified by Christianity, but Roman
    Catholic fathers, with the avowed determination to Christianize
    it, could not have lived there continuously for over a century and
    caused the great missions to be built without modifying the religious
    customs of the Zuñians. It is said that after the priests were driven
    out the Pueblos returned to their ancient practices, but it must be
    admitted that no one has yet shown how the pure Katcina practices were
    preserved over three generations. They returned to an old worship,
    but who has evidence to say that it was the same as that of their
    great-great-grandfathers?</p>

  <p>In some instances the natives have very willingly adopted Christian
    teachings and the Christian God, believing that by so doing their own
    religion would necessarily become strengthened by an addition to their
    pantheon. Such adoption, however, no matter how regarded by them, made
    a permanent impression on their primitive condition by changing their
    mode of thought and life.</p>

  <p>They apparently may have abandoned all that the church taught; but what
    means could have been used to restore the pure worship of pre-Columbian
    times? The culture which was revived was aboriginal, but could never be
    identical<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> with that of the times before Coronado.</p>

  <p>The question then resolves itself into a historical one—which pueblos
    were the home of Catholic priests for the shortest time, and in which
    were their influences least powerful? The historian will of course
    answer the Tusayan pueblos, and ethnology contributes her quota of
    facts to indicate that the purest form of Pueblo ceremonials are now
    practiced by these villagers.</p>

  <p>Although there are several ceremonials which the Hopi claim are not
    performed at Zuñi, and conversely others performed at Zuñi which are
    not observed in Tusayan, there is a similarity, differing in details,
    between the Kóko and Katcina dances close enough to show their
    identity. The Hopi recognize this fact, and to prove it I need only
    mention that the Áñakatcina in 1891 was danced at Zuñi by some of the
    Hopi as a Kóko. I have already pointed out the identity of the masks,
    paraphernalia, and songs of the Kókokshi, performed by the Zuñians,
    and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>the Áñakatcina at Walpi. There is no doubt in my mind that they
    are the same, but I can not accept the dictum that what is observed
    in one is identical with what exists in the other. There are slight
    modifications which exist likewise in different Hopi villages, as will
    be seen by a comparison of my descriptions of the two. One marked
    difference is that several Kókokshi dances were performed in the summer
    I spent at Zuñi, and that this identical Katcina (the Áña) is performed
    but once each summer in any one Hopi village.</p>

      (tablet removed).</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The only other Kóko<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> dance which I know of from personal
    observation is the tablet dance, which is in many respects homologous
    with the Húmiskatcina. The symbolism of the mask and tablet, however,
    differs from the Húmis, and while in a speculative way I regard them
    the same we must await more research to prove them identical. The
    subject is still more complicated by the fact that the Hopi have a
    tablet mask with still a third symbolic character, which they call the
    Zuñi or Síohúmiskatcina.</p>

  <p>I think we need have no hesitation in supposing that the so-called Sío
    (Zuñi) Katcina, which I have elsewhere described, is a Zuñi celebration
    derived from that pueblo. I do not know whether it is ever performed
    there in the same way as at Walpi, since it has not been described by
    any of the students of the Zuñians.</p>

  <p>We have, however, as before mentioned, a partial description by Cushing
    of the Zuñi Shálako, and from his account we can gather a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>few of
    the main points of difference between it and the Síocálako performed
    at Walpi and described in the preceding pages. The Hopi, however,
    have a Cálako of their own. They distinguish it from the Síocálako,
    which they not only recognize as of Zuñi origin, but are also able to
    designate the family which brought it from the Zuñians. The name of
    the celebration and the use of Zuñi words in it both point to this
    conclusion.</p>

  <p>The correspondence between the Héemashikwi, or last<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> dance—the
    tablet dance described by me elsewhere as occurring at the close of the
    series of Kókos—is probably the same as the Nimánkatcina. There are
    many similarities to indicate this fact, and, although as yet we know
    nothing of the secret observances connected with it, I suspect that a
    similarity between them and those described in the Móñkiva will later
    be made known.</p>

  <p>Dolls in imitation of the Héemashikwi are reported in the catalogue
    of Colonel James Stevenson’s collection from Zuñi in 1881, and I
    have no doubt it will be found that there formerly was, and possibly
    still survives, at the celebration of this dance at Zuñi the
    characteristic habit in Tusayan of distributing dolls as presents at
    the departure of the Katcinas.</p>

  <p>Mrs Stevenson has given short descriptions of some of the Zuñi Kókos
    and figures of the masks of the same. While it is not possible for
    me to use them in a comparison with Katcina celebrations, they are
    interesting in studies of symbolism. The “flogging Kókos,” for
    instance, seem to function the same as Túñwup among the Hopi, but as
    the symbolism of the mask of the floggers, Saiāhlias, is not given by
    Mrs Stevenson I am not able to express an opinion whether the same
    personage is intended or not. The time of year when the flagellation is
    inflicted by the Saiāhlia of Zuñi would be an interesting observation,
    and the accompanying ceremonials would also be of great interest for
    comparison with the Powámû.</p>

  <p>I have not been able to find the equivalents of the Sälämobias among
    the Hopi, but the symbolism of Pooatíwa agrees almost exactly with that
    of the Hopi Paútiwa.</p>

  <p>The Sälämobias of the different world-quarters agree in color with
    those assigned by the Hopi to the same points, with the exception of
    those for the above and below. In Zuñi, according to Cushing and Mrs
    Stevenson, the above is all colors, the below black. Among the Hopi the
    above was found to be black and the below all colors. This discrepancy
    in observations is recommended as a good subject for future students,
    both in Tusayan and Zuñi.</p>

  <p>In reviewing the Hopi ceremonial personages I have been unable to find
    any homology with the Sälämobias. The views of the masks<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>given
    by Mrs Stevenson afford little information on this subject, but in
    her sand picture, surrounded by the Plumed Snake, I find some of the
    figures of Sälämobias with indication of a connecting band between the
    eyes, which recalls Paútiwa’s<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> symbolism. There does not seem to be
    a wide difference between the profile views of the masks of Paútiwa and
    Sälämobia of the different world-quarters.</p>

  <p>The environment of the pueblos of Tusayan and of Cibola is so similar
    and the rain-cloud worship so imperative in both that, a priori, we
    should expect the rain-cloud symbol to be as frequent in Zuñi as in
    Walpi. I am much surprised therefore in studying the description of
    Zuñi ceremonials to find nothing said of the characteristic Hopi
    symbols of the rain clouds, the semicircles and the parallel lines of
    falling rain (plate <a href="#CVIII"><span class="allsmcap"><abbr title="108">CVIII</abbr></span></a>). If the rain clouds at Zuñi are
    limited to the terraced<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> figures found on the prayer-meal bowls and
    the same made in sacred meal we certainly have a significant difference
    between the symbolism of these two peoples. In Tusayan there is not
    one of the great religious festivals where the semicircular clouds and
    falling rain do not appear as symbols. Thus far students of the Zuñi
    ceremonials have not figured one instance in which they are used.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

  <p>The short account of the effigy of the Plumed Snake (Kólowisi) with
    attendant ceremonials at Zuñi, by Mrs Stevenson, shows the existence
    of archaic rites with the Plumed Serpent which have been observed in a
    different form (Pálülükoñti) at Tusayan. The time of the year when the
    Zuñi effigy is brought to the kivas on a rude altar is not given; nor
    is the special name of the ceremony. The conch shell is similarly used
    to imitate the voice of the Plumed Serpent at Zuñi, as at Walpi, in the
    Soyáluña and the Pálülükoñti. In neither of these ceremonials, however,
    have the effigies been observed to be carried ceremonially about the
    pueblos of the Tusayan mesas. The symbolism of Pálülükoñti and Kólowisi
    seems to differ, judging from published accounts and symbolism on Zuñi
    and Hopi pottery. I find no intimation of the horn on the head of Zuñi
    pictures of the Plumed Snake, and the arrowhead decoration fails on
    the body. The two crescents which are common on the body of the Zuñi
    figures have not been observed in Hopi pictographs or effigies.</p>

  <p>It would seem both from legendary and other reasons that there has not
    been the warmest friendship between the inhabitants of Tusayan and
    Cibola. This is not to be wondered at, for only on rare occasions has
    there been good feeling between two pueblos even of the same <span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>speech.
    The massacre of Awatobi at the hands of the other Hopi has been told
    elsewhere, and even at the present day Oraibi is not on the best of
    terms with the other Hopi towns. The legends of the Hopi are full
    of quarrels of one pueblo with another, and bitter hatred sometimes
    developing into bloody wars in which their own kindred were attacked
    and pueblos destroyed.</p>

  <p>In her article, “A chapter of Zuñi mythology,”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Mrs Stevenson
    says: “The Ahshiwanni,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> a priesthood of fourteen men who fast
    and pray for rain; the Kokko, an organization bearing the name of
    anthropomorphic beings (principally ancestral) whom they personate,
    and thirteen esoteric societies are the three fundamental religious
    bodies of Zuñi.... The society of the Kokko personate anthropomorphic
    gods by wearing masks and other paraphernalia. There are six estufas
    or chambers of the Kokko for the six regions, the north, west, south,
    east, zenith, and nadir, and these rooms present fantastic scenes
    when the primitive drama is enacted by the personators of these
    anthropomorphic gods.... The esoteric societies, with but one or two
    exceptions, have nothing to do with anthropomorphic beings, this
    category of gods being zoomorphic.”</p>

  <p>Accepting these statements as a correct idea of the “three fundamental
    religious bodies of Zuñi” I find great difficulty in tracing an
    intimate relation between them and those of the Hopi system. A large
    number of the Katcinas are anthropomorphic and likewise ancestral.
    They bear the names of animals, and in that sense may be called in
    some instances zoomorphic. Walpi, however, has but five kivas, the
    members of each of which in the Powámû personify different Katcinas.
    I have not yet discovered that each of these kivas is associated with
    a different cardinal world-quarter, as Mrs Stevenson finds to be the
    case in Zuñi. The esoteric societies of the Zuñi, according to Mrs
    Stevenson, “with but one or two exceptions have nothing to do with
    anthropomorphic beings.” I am not able to harmonize my observations
    of the secret societies in Tusayan with the definition given of the
    esoteric societies in Zuñi, and must await some clearer insight into
    the character of the latter before offering any discussion of several
    resemblances which can be detected. From an examination of Cushing’s
    article in the <cite>Century Magazine</cite>, in which the esoteric societies
    of Zuñi are briefly defined, I am led to believe that the so-called
    esoteric societies in that pueblo differ a good deal from those in
    Walpi. The Hopi testify that while some of their secret fraternities
    are represented in Zuñi several of them are not identical.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span></p>

  <p>Mrs Stevenson does not make it clear who these fourteen (six) so-called
    Ahshiwanni are, but calls them “rain priests.” She intimates that they
    appeal directly to the Sun father, their supreme deity, and to the rain
    makers, while the “societies” address “the beast gods of their worship
    to intercede with the Sun father and rain makers.” There is apparently
    no parallelism between these conditions and those at Tusayan, but
    I can readily find truth in the statement when applied to the Hopi
    that “no society convenes without giving much time to invocations for
    rain.” I am sure that some of the societies at Tusayan do not appeal to
    the beast gods to intercede with the Sun father and rain makers, but
    address the latter directly in their prayers. In this particular there
    is certainly a marked difference between the conceptions back of the
    rites in Tusayan and those ascribed to the Cibolans.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

  <p>The custom of the Yókimoñwi, or rain chief, retiring alone to a cell
    to pray for rain was practiced in Tusayan. One of these retreats is to
    be seen at the Middle mesa. Among the foothills there is a block of
    sandstone, 15 feet long, 5 feet wide, and 4 feet thick. Its flat face
    is about horizontal or slightly tilted toward the northeast. Portions
    of a rough wall are still in place under the block, confirming the
    story that there was here formerly a chamber of which the block was the
    roof. An aperture on the northeastern corner, about 20 inches square,
    is usually closed with loose stones, but the chamber is now filled in
    with sand to within about 2 feet of the roof or lower surface of the
    slab. The interior of the chamber was about 8 feet long and 4 feet
    wide. On the roof, which was painted white, are figures of yellow,
    green, red, and white rain clouds with parallel lines of falling rain
    and zigzag lightning symbols in conventional patterns. To this chamber,
    it is said, the Rain chief of the Water people retired at planting time
    and lived there sixteen days, his food being brought to him by a girl
    during his vigils. He <span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>was able by his prayers to bring the rain. These
    visits were made long ago, but even now there are páhos strewn about
    the chamber, and devout persons visit the place at the present day
    with a nakwákwoci and pray for rain. Although the Rain chief no longer
    passes the sixteen days there, it is a holy place for the purposes
    mentioned.</p>

  <p>“The earth,” says Mrs Stevenson,<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> “is watered by the deceased Zuñi
    of both sexes, who are controlled and directed by a council composed of
    ancestral gods. These shadow people collect water in vases and gourd
    jugs from the six great waters of the world, and pass to and fro over
    the middle plane, protected from view of the people below by cloud
    masks.”</p>

  <p>I find a different conception from this of the rain-making powers
    of the dead among the Hopi. Among other ceremonials, when certain
    persons die, after the chin has been blackened, the body washed, and
    prescribed feathers placed on different parts of it, a thin wad of raw
    cotton in which is punched holes for the eyes is laid upon the face.
    This is a mask and is called a rain-cloud or “prayer to the dead to
    bring the rain.” In general, as many writers have said, the use of the
    mask transforms the wearer into a deity designated by the symbolism
    of the same,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and as a consequence the dead, we may theoretically
    suppose, are thereby endowed with supernatural powers to bring rain.
    The Ómowûhs, however, are the Rain gods, and so far as I can explain
    the significance of the symbolic rain-cloud mask on the face of the
    dead and the black color on the chin, it is simply a method of prayer
    through the divinized dead to the Rain-cloud deities. Among the Hopi
    the earth is watered by the Rain-gods, but the dead are ceremonially
    made intercessors to affect them. In this view of the case the Hopi may
    be said to believe that the earth is “watered by the deceased of both
    sexes.”</p>

  <p>The Hopi believe that the breath body of the Zuñi goes to a sacred
    place near Saint Johns, called Wénima. There the dead are supposed to
    be changed into Katcinas, and the place is reputed to be one of the
    homes of these personages. It is likewise specially spoken of as the
    house of Cálako, and it is believed that the Zuñi hold the same views
    of this mysterious place. In lagoons near it turtles are abundant,
    and not far away Mr Hubbell and others discovered sacrificial caverns
    in which were large collections of pottery. Tótci, a Hopi resident of
    Zuñi, is the authority for the statement that the Cibolans do not use
    the raw cotton mortuary mask, although they blacken the face of the
    dead chiefs. He says the same idea of divinization of the breath body
    into a Katcina seems to be current among the Zuñi as among the Hopi.</p>

  <p>According to Mrs Stevenson the father of the Kokko is Kaklo (Kyäklu),
    whose servants are the Sälämobiyas. The name of their mother is not
    known to me. The Katcinas are said to be the offspring of an Earth
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>goddess,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> who figures under many names. Their father’s name on
    comparative grounds is supposed to be Táwa, the sun, or Túñwup, their
    elder brother.</p>

  <p>A study of the group of Katcina ceremonials as compared with the Kóko
    brings out in prominence the conclusion that while some of them may be
    identical, as a rule there is considerable difference in the ritual of
    the Tusayan people and their nearest neighbor, the Zuñi. If variations
    exist between these neighbors we are justified in the suspicion,
    which observation as far as it has thus far gone supports, that there
    are even wider differences between pueblos more distant from each
    other. The ethnologist fully cognizant with the ritual in one pueblo
    has a general conception of the character of all, but changes due to
    suppression of ceremonials, survivals, dying out of societies, and many
    other causes have modified the pueblos in different ways. The character
    of the ancient system is adulterated in all. We can form an idea of
    this modification in no better way than by a minute study of the
    existing ritual in every pueblo. Upon such comprehensive study science
    is at the very threshold.</p>

  <p>The foregoing pages open many considerations of a theoretical nature
    which I have not attempted to develop. My greatest solicitude has been
    to sketch the outline of the Katcina ceremonials as performed at the
    Hopi village of Walpi in Tusayan.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> It would be interesting to know what relationship exists
      between abbreviated and elaborate Katcinas. Are the former, for
      instance, remnants of more complicated presentations in which the
      secret elements have been dropped in the course of time? Were they
      formerly more complicated, or are they in lower stages of evolution,
      gathering episodes which if left alone would finally make them more
      complex? I incline to the belief that the abbreviated Katcinas are
      remnants, and their reduction due to practical reasons. In a general
      way the word Katcina may be translated “soul” or “deified ancestor,”
      and in this respect affords most valuable data to the upholders of the
      animistic theory. But there are other elements in Tusayan mythology
      which are not animistic. As Mogk has well shown in Teutonic mythology,
      nature elements and the great gods are original, so among the Hopi
      the nature elements are not identified with remote ancestors, nor is
      there evidence that their worship was derivative. As Saussaye remarks,
      “Animism is always and everywhere mixed up with religion; it is never
      and nowhere the whole of religion.”

    <a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> From their many stories of the under world I am led
      to believe that the Hopi consider it a counterpart of the earth’s
      surface, and a region inhabited by sentient beings. In this under
      world the seasons alternate with those in the upper world, and when
      it is summer in the above it is winter in the world below, and vice
      versa. Moreover, ceremonies are said to be performed there as here, and
      frequent references are made to their character. It is believed that
      these ceremonies somewhat resemble each other and are complemental. In
      their cultus of the dead the under world is also regarded as the abode
      of the “breath-body” of the deceased, who enter it through a sípapu,
      often spoken of as a lake. I have not detected that they differentiate
      this world into two regions, the abode of the blessed and that of the
      damned.

    <a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> Note the similarity in sound to the Nahuatl month,
      Quecholli, in which the Atamalqualiztli was celebrated. See “A
      Central American ceremony which suggests the Snake dance of the
      Tusayan villagers,” American Anthropologist, Washington, vol. VI,
      No. 3. Quecholli, however, according to both Sahagun and Serna,
      was in November. The Snake dance at Walpi is thus celebrated about
      six months from Atamalqualiztli, or not far from the time when the
      people of the under world celebrate their Snake-Antelope solemnities.
      In this connection attention may be called to the fact that the
      Snake-Antelope priests in Walpi have a simple gathering in the winter
      Pa moon (January), when their sacerdotal kindred of the under world
      are supposed by them to be performing their unabbreviated snake rites.
      This is at most only about a month from the time Atamalqualiztli was
      celebrated. Teotlico, the Nahuatl return of the war god, occurred
      in November; Soyáluña, the warriors’ return, in December. There are
      important comparative data hearing on the likeness of Hopi and Nahuatl
      ceremonies hidden in the resemblance between Kwetcála and Quecholli
      (Kwetcoli).

      The name is very similar to that for moon. This was the ruler of the

      willow framework which forms a kind of visor, and if, as I suspect from
      the “large pasteboard [skin over framework or wooden board] tower,” it
      was a tablet or nákci, the personification mentioned by Ten Broeck may
      have been a Humískatcina. In May, 1891, I observed a Humís, but there
      is no reason from the theory of the time of abbreviated Katcinas to
      limit it to May. It might have been performed in April equally well.

      The derivation is obscure; possibly it is from kátci, spread out,
      horizontal, the surface of the earth, náa, father, abbreviated na,
      surface of land, father. The Tusayan Indians say that their Katcinas
      are the same as the Zuñi Kóko, pronouncing the word as here spelled.
      Cushing insists, however, that the proper name of the organization is
      Kâ′kâ. I find Mrs Stevenson, in her valuable article on the Religious
      Life of a Zuñi Child, has used the spelling Kok′ko, which introduces
      the o sound which the Tusayan people distinctly use in speaking of the
      Katcinas of their nearest Pueblo neighbors. This variation in spelling
      of one of the more common words by conscientious observers shows one of
      the difficulties which besets the path of those who attempt etymologic
      dissection of Pueblo words. Many Zuñi words in the mouths of the Hopi
      suffer strange modifications, so that I am not greatly surprised to
      find idiomatic differences between the Hopi dialect of the East mesa
      and that of Oraibi. How much may result after years of separation
      no one can tell, but the linguist must be prepared to find these
      differences very considerable.

    <a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">[36]</a> The Hopi report that the Zuñi believe that the dead are
      changed into Katcinas and go to a Sípapû, which they descend and tell
      the “chiefs” to send the rain. The Hopi believe that the dead become
      divinized (Katcinas in a loose meaning) and intercede for rain. (See
      discussion of Mrs Stevenson’s statement that the dead send rain.) It
      seems to me that students of primitive myth and ritual have hardly
      begun to realize the important part which orientation plays in early
      religions. As research progresses it will be found to be of primary
      importance. The idea of world-quarter deities sprang from astronomical
      conceptions and was derived from a primitive sun worship in which the
      lesser deities naturally came to be associated with the four horizon
      points of solstitial sunrise and sunset.
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="label">[37]</a> I have elsewhere pointed out that the típoni is called
      the mother, and this usage seems to hold among the other Pueblos. As a
      badge of chieftaincy it is carried by the chiefs on certain occasions
      of initiation and public exhibitions, as can be seen by consulting my
      memoir of the Snake Ceremonials at Walpi. Címo, the old Flute chief
      (obit 1893), once made the following remark about his típoni: “This is
      my mother; the outer wrapping is her garment; the string of shells is
      her necklace; the feathers typify the birds, and within it are all the
      desirable seeds. When I go to sleep she watches over me, and when I die
      one of the feathers will be placed upon my heart, and I hope the típoni
      will take care of me.” From these words we learn how much the típoni is
      venerated, and it is not remarkable, considering the benefits which are
      thought to come from it, that it is designated “the mother.”

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">[38]</a> I mention this fact since, following Bandolier’s studios
      among the Rio Grande Pueblos, we have something different. The Koshare,
      which appear to correspond with a group of the Tcukúwympkiya, the
      Paiakyamû, are regarded by him as the summer and autumn men, while
      the Cuirana are the spring men. During the late summer and autumn
      the Tcukúwympkiya take no part in the ceremonials at the East mesa
      of Tusayan. No Tcukúwympkiyas appear in the Snake, Flute, Lálakoñti,
      Mamzraúti, Wüwütcímti, or in certain minor festivals. They appear to be
      almost universal accompaniments of the Katcina observances.

      of growth, and its characteristics are treated in the several
      already published articles devoted to these subjects. In none of the
      abbreviated Katcinas described was there an altar or complicated
      kiva performance, but on the other hand, in the elaborate Katcinas
      such secret observances always existed. Síocalako, described in this
      article, affords an interesting abbreviated ceremonial with kiva rites.

      which a sacred dance is taking place, it is customary for the hosts to
      entertain by setting before them food, and it is no uncommon thing to
      see visitors passing from house to house partaking of the píkami (mush)
      and other delicacies. It is not unusual for the headmen of one pueblo
      to send official thanks to the people of another for their sacred
      dances and other efforts for rain. In a memoir on the Snake dance I
      mention an instance where even the distant Havasupai Indians brought
      offerings from their home to Walpi (Journal of American Ethnology and
      Archæology, vol. <span class="allsmcap">IV</span>).

      in the kiva and the feast is held in the same place. At Tusayan the
      feast is open, and generally there is no unmasked dance. The feast in
      the kiva at Zuñi is possibly a secondary modification for effecting
      secrecy.

      The Paiakaíamû rushed up to me and demanded a knife, and when I refused
      to give it, not aware of their intention, they sought other ways to
      kill the poor brute. It was an exhibition of extreme savagery, but of
      course with no danger to any of the spectators. Later in their antics
      the gluttons themselves were lightly struck with a cactus branch,
      and the person who performed this painful act went from housetop to
      housetop touching the arm or neck of every spectator—man, woman, and
      child. During this dance these Tcukuwympkiyas performed the disgusting
      act of drinking human urine. Mr Cushing, in the Century Magazine,
      records the slaughter of a dog in a similar manner, except that he says
      that his life was threatened before the dog was killed, and it was by
      his defiant attitude that he was not seized by the performers.

    <a id="Footnote_116" href="#FNanchor_116" class="label">[116]</a> The direction of the ceremonial circuit of the Tewa is
      sinistral. In this instance it began at the east. I believe this is
      the prescribed circuit of all the Pueblos. Some of the Tewa have told
      me that in their folktales their people did not emerge from the same
      sípapû as the Hopi, but from a sípapû to the east. Although some of
      the priests say that all people came from the middle of the earth,
      from one sípapû, others believe that each pueblo has its own ancestral
      geographical opening. The idea has been localized by environment, as is
      so often the case with modified legends.

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_117" href="#FNanchor_117" class="label">[117]</a> There are certainly more evidences of white man’s

      instance, as the use of hats and calico shirts in dances, American
      chairs, rifles, etc, etc.
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_118" href="#FNanchor_118" class="label">[118]</a> Notwithstanding this statement, I have already pointed
      out similarities between both these women’s celebrations and certain
      Zuñi dances (see American Anthropologist, vol. <span class="allsmcap">V</span>, p. 236,
      note).
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_119" href="#FNanchor_119" class="label">[119]</a> Hówina (Zuñi, Ówinahe), a kind of thanksgiving dance,
      is distinctly a Zuñi dance and is so recognized by the Hopi. I
      have seen photographs of the celebration at Zuñi which bear such a
      close resemblance to that called by the Hopi the Hówina that in all
      probability the two are identical. The elaborate war dances celebrated
      at Zuñi and the observances of the Priesthood of the Bow at that pueblo
      are very much abbreviated in Tusayan (East mesa) where the organization
      has not the same power as with the Cibolans.
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_120" href="#FNanchor_120" class="label">[120]</a> Cipaulovi, or the “Place of Peaches,” would necessarily
      have received its name after those who brought peaches came among the
      Hopi. It is known that Sitcomovi was a late colony of Asa people from
      the Rio Grande, united with others from Walpi, while Hano was founded
      about 1700. The Cipaulovi people, however celebrate the Flute ceremony,
      and the Flute people came to Tusayan shortly after the Snake. It would
      thus appear that we have a date to determine that the Flute people came
      to Tusayan after Vargas (1692). Morfi, in 1782, says that the people of
      Xipaulovi (Cipaulovi) came from Xongopabi (Cuñopavi).

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_121" href="#FNanchor_121" class="label">[121]</a> I do not for a moment doubt that even when nominally

    <a id="Footnote_122" href="#FNanchor_122" class="label">[122]</a> Coco in Spanish signifies a bogy. In compounds it can be
      detected in Cocomaricopa, where it may mean fool, possibly referring to
      the inferiority of this stem. The derivation of Kóko or Kâ′&NoBreak;kâ is not
      known to me. The word Katcina has the advantage of Kóko or Kâ′&NoBreak;kâ as a
      general designation.
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_123" href="#FNanchor_123" class="label">[123]</a> That is, the last Katcina before their departure
      in Cibola, as in Tusayan. In Walpi it is not an autumn dance, but
      occurs at about the same time that I witnessed it at Zuñi, near the
      end of July (see Journal of American Ethnology and Archæology, vol.
      <span class="allsmcap">I</span>, No. 1).
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_124" href="#FNanchor_124" class="label">[124]</a> It is recommended that in illustrating Zuñi masks a
      full face view be given, for in that way the symbolism is much better

  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_125" href="#FNanchor_125" class="label">[125]</a> Pooatíwa is considered by Mrs Stevenson the “Sun
      Father.” I have not gone far enough in my studies to accept this
      relationship for Paútiwa. There are some reasons for considering
      Paútiwa the Mist Father, which speculation has led me to interpret
      the Sälämobias as Paútiwa forms of the rain-clouds of the six
      world-quarters, but such an opinion is highly theoretical.
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_126" href="#FNanchor_126" class="label">[126]</a> The terraced elevations are common on the Zuñi nákwipis
      and handled prayer-meal bowls, as can be seen in any large collection
      of Zuñi ceramics; but the semicircular rain-cloud figures are very
      rare, indeed wanting, in all I have seen. The frog, tadpole, snake, and
      similar symbols appear, however, to be present in both. The question of
      the characteristic symbolism of Zuñi and Hopi pottery is a complicated
      one, which can not be considered in this article, but the two types can
      readily be distinguished by a student of this subject.
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_127" href="#FNanchor_127" class="label">[127]</a> It would be a remarkable fact if accounts of this
      symbolism are not later described.

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_129" href="#FNanchor_129" class="label">[129]</a> On page 314 she mentions six Ahshiwanni as “rain
      priests.” I am not able to definitely decide from the text whether
      these six are the same as the fourteen mentioned above. It is not
      clear to me in which group Mrs Stevenson places the “Mud-heads” and
      “Gluttons,” well described by Ten Broeck in 1852 from Tusayan, and
      later by herself and Cushing from Zuñi, and by other writers from the
      Rio Grande pueblos.
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_130" href="#FNanchor_130" class="label">[130]</a> If these statements are true one sees that they tell in
      favor of the theory which the ritual emphasized, and that while in a
      general way there is a similarity between the ceremonial system of the
      two people, it is absurd to say that “what is written of one is true
      also of the other.” Long ago their systems may have been identical; at
      present they have more or less differentiated one from the other. In
      Zuñi, according to Mrs Stevenson, “at the winter and summer solstices
      synchronal meetings of most of these societies are held, and also at
      other times.” After having carefully studied the ceremonials at the
      time of the summer solstice at Tusayan, I have not found any synchronal
      meetings of the societies which correspond with those mentioned as
      occurring at Zuñi at that time.
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_131" href="#FNanchor_131" class="label">[131]</a> It is desirable that the names of the priests who
      officiate in ceremonials be given in extended accounts of them in order
      that the intimate character of this sacerdotal organization may be
      made out. Until the names of the members of the different societies
      are complete we are more or less hampered in our studies. The Zuñi
      equivalent of wympkia appears to be kyalikwe (Tcihkyalikwe, Snake
      priests from tcihtola, snake, and kyalikwe, wympkia). I am unable to
      tell to what priests in Tusayan the “Ahshiwanni” correspond. The Tawa
      (Sun) wympkia or Sun priests have certain points in common with them,
      but this is as truly an esoteric society as any in Tusayan. I have
      elsewhere described the Tewa ceremony in which the Sun priests make
      the páhos and their chief, Kálacai, appeals directly to the rising
      sun. In that same ceremony páhos are likewise made to the Rain gods
      directly. In the Katcina celebrations some of the same Sun priests,
      however, appeal to the leader of the Katcinas to bring them rain, and
      this personage replies that he will. In this case, supposing, as I
      think we justly can, that the Katcinas are intercessors between men
      and gods of highest rank, we have in Tusayan the possible equivalent
      of the “Ahshiwanni (rain priests)” intrusting their prayers to a
      zoomorphic and anthropomorphic supernatural personage. The prayer of a
      single chief for rain for the people, showing something similar to the
      so-called Ahshiwanni at Zuñi, are not uncommon in Tusayan. In Tusayan
      an organization of rain priests is not differentiated at the present
      day from the other societies. All holders of wímis are Rain priests, as
      well as the organization called the Sun priests, and all at times make
      special prayers to the Rain gods.

      studies of burial customs suggests that the habit of masking the dead

      that several personages may be the same “Earth goddess.” Kókyanwüqti,
      the Spider woman, is also an “Earth goddess.” As everything, even man
      himself, came from the womb of the earth, symbolized by the spider, it
      is not surprising that an Indian should call the spider the creator. It
      is a very different thing, however, to interpret such information by
      our philosophic ideas. That the primitive should consider the earth as
      the mother of everything, its creator in one sense, is natural; that
      the Pueblo Indian should symbolize that mother by the Spider woman is
      probable, for other races have done likewise; but that he associates
      with mother earth the spiritual idea which we have of the Creator is
      absurd. His cosmogony bears no evidence that he rose, in pre-Columbian
      times, to the belief in a Great Spirit who created the universe.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
